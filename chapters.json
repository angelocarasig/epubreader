I want your honest opinion. \n Are people equal or not? \n A proper society will constantly strive for equality. There are those who clamor for men and women to always be considered equal. As a result, we raised the employment rate for women, we made specialized subway cars only for women. Sometimes, women will even argue over the order of names in a family register. The public opinion of people with disabilities has also changed. We\u2019re now told that we should not use the term \u201cdisabled people\u201d when referring to them, so as not to discriminate. Nowadays, children are taught that all people are created equal. \n But is that true? I have my doubts. If men and women have different abilities, then their roles should also differ. People with disabilities are still disabled, no matter what polite euphemisms you use. No matter how you try to avert your eyes, the meaning of the word does not change. \n So, my answer would be, \u201cNo, we are not equal.\u201d To be human is to be unequal. Equality does not exist. \n Long ago, in a bygone era, a great man said that heaven does not set one man above or below any other. However, he did not necessarily adhere to the idea that everyone is equal. Did you know that there is more to that famous passage? The rest goes like this: Everyone is equal when they are born, so I ask, why do we see differences in position and status? And it continues: Do you or do you not encourage learning to create a difference? So then, education creates an imbalance. The point\u2019s spelled out there, in the incredibly famous work Gakumon no Sume . Even though this is the year 2015, the modern era, nothing about these teachings has changed. The situation has only grown more complex and fraught. \n In any case, we are human beings. We are living, thinking creatures. \n I don\u2019t think it right to simply say that we are unequal and then live our lives based on pure instinct. In other words, though \u201cequality\u201d is a complete lie, we cannot accept inequality, either. Right now, I\u2019m trying to come up with a new answer for humanity\u2019s eternal question. \n Hey, you there. You, the one reading this book right now. Have you ever given serious thought to the future? \n Have you ever considered the purpose of going to high school or to college? Though the future may seem hazy right now, do you think you\u2019ll find a job someday? That\u2019s what I used to think. Back when I finished my compulsory education and became a high school student, I hadn\u2019t really considered the future. I\u2019d only felt joy at being nearly free of obligation. I didn\u2019t consider the incredible influence that school would continue to have in my life, on my future. I didn\u2019t even understand the purpose behind studying language or numbers. \n "], "Chapter 14": ["==============="], "Chapter 15": ["Chapter 2: Welcome to the School Life of Your Dreams \n \u201cA yanokouji-kun, do you have a moment?\u201d \n She came. She was here. It was terrifying. I\u2019d been feigning sleep during class, pondering society\u2019s true purpose while I pretended to nap, when the devil approached me. Shostakovich\u2019s Symphony No. 11 played in my head, music that captured the sense of people fleeing from pursuing demons and the desperation that comes at the end of the world. Right then, it was the perfect accompaniment. \n Even though my eyes were closed, I understood. I could feel the devil\u2019s presence as she waited for her slave to awaken. So, as a slave, how exactly could I get out of this situation? \n My computer-like brain instantly executed all the calculations to arrive at the answer I most needed. \n Conclusion: I\u2019d pretend not to hear her. I had dubbed this the \u201cSleeping Strategy.\u201d If she were a kind girl, then she would say something like, \u201cAw, well, there\u2019s nothing to be done. I\u2019d feel bad to wake you, so I\u2019ll forgive you.\u00a0\u2605\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t get up, I\u2019ll kiss you!\u201d would also be okay. \n \u201cIf you do not awaken within three seconds, I will bestow additional punishment upon you.\u201d \n \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018punishment\u2019?\u201d I asked. \n In an instant, I\u2019d abandoned my \u201cSleeping Strategy\u201d and yielded to her threats of force. Well, at least I offered some resistance by not meeting her gaze. \n \u201cSee, you are awake after all, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she said. \n \u201cI know enough that I\u2019m afraid to make you angry.\u201d \n \u201cGlad to hear it. Well then, may I have a little of your time?\u201d \n \u201cIf I refuse?\u201d \n \u201cWell, even though you have no right to veto such a decision, I suppose I would be exceptionally displeased.\u201d \n She continued with, \u201cAnd when I am displeased, then I will prove a major obstacle to your school life, Ayanokouji-kun. For example, I might set a great number of thumbtacks on your chair. Or, when you go to the toilet, I might splash water on you from above. Or stab you with the needle of my mathematical compass. Those kinds of obstacles, I suppose.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s nothing but harassment, or rather, bullying! And besides, that last one sounds strangely familiar, because you\u2019ve already stabbed me before!\u201d \n I reluctantly sat up at my desk. A girl with beautiful, sharp eyes and long black hair that framed her face stared down at me. Her name was Horikita Suzune, a student of the Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School, Class D, and my classmate. \n \u201cDon\u2019t worry. That was only a joke. I wouldn\u2019t splash water on you from above.\u201d \n \u201cWhat\u2019s more pressing are the thumbtacks and the compass needle! Look at this! There are still marks from when you stabbed me the last time! Will you take responsibility if it scars me for life?\u201d I rolled up my right sleeve and displayed my forearm to Horikita, so she could see the scars she\u2019d left behind. \n \u201cEvidence?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cHuh?\u201d \n \u201cWhat about the evidence? Did you decide I\u2019m the culprit without evidence?\u201d \n She was right; there was no evidence. Even though Horikita was the only one in class close enough to stab me with a needle, I\u2019d be hard-pressed to call that definitive proof\u2026 \n Well, I needed to confirm something first anyway. \n \u201cSo, I\u2019m required to help you? I\u2019ve thought on it again, and, after all, I\u2014\u201d \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun. Would you prefer to regret while you suffer or regret while you despair? Which would you like more? Because if you refuse me and force my hand, it will be your responsibility.\u201d \n I was stuck with Horikita\u2019s two completely absurd choices. It appeared she would not accept any delays. Though it was a mistake to make a deal with this devil, I gave up and obeyed. \n \u201cAll right, then. What am I supposed to do?\u201d I asked, filled with trepidation. Her requests no longer surprised me. I certainly didn\u2019t like how this situation had turned out, but\u2026 I thought back to when I\u2019d met this girl two months ago, on the day of the entrance ceremony. \n "], "Chapter 16": ["==============="], "Chapter 17": ["2.1 \n A pril. The school entrance ceremony. I rode the bus to school, bobbing and shaking in my seat. While I looked idly out my window, watching the city\u2019s scenery change, the bus picked up more and more passengers. \n Most of them were young people wearing high school uniforms. \n There was also a frustrated salary worker, who looked like the type to have once mistakenly groped someone aboard a crowded bus. An unsteady elderly lady stood in front of me, wobbling so badly I thought she was in danger of falling. Considering I\u2019d known how packed this bus would likely be, I supposed I was simply reaping what I\u2019d sown by getting on. \n I was fortunate to have found a seat, but it was still crowded. I forgot about the unfortunate elderly woman and patiently waited to arrive at my destination, my mind clear as a passing stream. The weather was especially fine today, not a single cloud in the sky. It was so refreshing that I nearly fell asleep then and there. \n However, my gentle respite was promptly obliterated. \n \u201cExcuse me, but shouldn\u2019t you offer up your seat?\u201d \n My eyes, which were about to close, snapped back open. Huh? Could this person be angry with me? But I realized that it was someone else being scolded. \n A young, well-built blond man of high school age had sat down in one of the priority seats. The elderly woman stood right next to him, and another woman stood beside her. This second, younger lady appeared to be an office worker. \n \u201cHey, you there. Can\u2019t you see that this elderly woman is having trouble?\u201d the office lady said. \n She seemed to want the young man to offer up his seat. \n Her voice carried quite well throughout the quiet bus, attracting several people\u2019s attention. \n \u201cThat\u2019s a really crazy question, lady,\u201d the boy said. \n I wondered whether the boy was angry, unobservant, or just painfully honest. In any case, he grinned broadly and crossed his legs. \u201cWhy should I offer up my seat? There\u2019s no reason for me to do so.\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re sitting in a priority seat. It\u2019s natural to offer up those seats to the elderly.\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Priority seats are just that: priority seats. I have no legal obligation to move. Since I\u2019m currently occupying this seat, I should be the one who determines whether or not I move. Am I supposed to give up my seat just because I\u2019m young? Ha! That reasoning is nonsense.\u201d \n He didn\u2019t speak like a normal high school student. His hair was dyed blond, which made him stand out. \n \u201cI\u2019m a healthy young person who certainly wouldn\u2019t find standing inconvenient. However, I\u2019d obviously expend more energy by standing than I would by sitting. I have no intention of doing such a pointless thing. Or are you suggesting I should act a bit livelier, I wonder?\u201d \n \u201cWh-what kind of attitude is that to take with your superiors?\u201d she demanded. \n \u201cSuperiors? Well, it\u2019s obvious that both you and the old woman there been alive longer than I have. There can be no doubt about that. However, the word \u2018superior\u2019 implies that you\u2019re referring to someone of a higher position. In addition, we have another problem. Even though our ages are different, wouldn\u2019t you agree that you have an impertinent attitude and are being extremely rude?\u201d \n \u201cWha\u2014 You\u2019re a high schooler, aren\u2019t you?! You should be quiet and listen to what adults tell you!\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s f-fine, whatever\u2026\u201d the elderly woman mumbled. \n She apparently didn\u2019t want any further commotion and tried to calm the office lady. But after being insulted by the high school student, the younger woman still seemed very upset. \n \u201cApparently, this elderly woman is more perceptive than you, which is nice. Also, I haven\u2019t given up on Japanese society yet. Please enjoy your remaining years.\u201d \n After flashing a pointlessly vigorous smile, the boy slid his earphones in and began listening to rather cacophonous music. The office lady now clenched her teeth in frustration. Though she tried needling the boy by arguing further, his smug, self-important attitude remained fixed. \n At any rate, I had to at least partly agree with the boy. \n If you ignored the question of a moral imperative, it was true that he wasn\u2019t legally obligated to give up his seat. \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Desperately fighting back her tears, the office lady apologized to the elderly woman. \n Well, it was all just a minor incident on the bus. I was relieved that I hadn\u2019t been caught up in the situation. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less about giving up my seat for an elderly person. \n Clearly, the egotistical boy had won. At least, everyone secretly thought so. \n \u201cUm\u2026 I think that the lady is right.\u201d \n The woman received unexpected support from someone standing alongside her. The helper, a girl wearing my high school\u2019s uniform, gave her brave and frank opinion to the boy. \n \u201cAnd the new challenger is a pretty girl, eh? It would seem that I\u2019m rather lucky with the fairer sex,\u201d the boy said. \n \u201cThis poor woman appears to have been suffering for quite some time now. Won\u2019t you offer up your seat? While you might consider such courtesy unnecessary, I think it would contribute greatly to society.\u201d \n Crack! The boy snapped his fingers. \n \u201cA contribution to society, you say? Well, that is a rather interesting opinion. It\u2019s certainly true that offering up one\u2019s seat to the elderly could be viewed in such a positive light. Unfortunately, I have no interest in contributing to society. I care only for my own satisfaction. Oh, and one more thing. You\u2019re asking me, the one in the priority seat, to give up his spot, but couldn\u2019t you simply ask one of the other people seated on this crowded bus? If you truly cared for the elderly, then something like priority seating would be a rather trivial concern, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d \n The boy\u2019s haughty attitude remained unchanged. Both the office lady and the elderly woman simply wore bitter smiles in response. However, the girl didn\u2019t back down. \n \u201cEveryone, please listen to me for just a moment. Won\u2019t someone give up their seat for this woman? It doesn\u2019t matter who. Please.\u201d \n "], "Chapter 18": ["==============="], "Chapter 19": [" filename=\"static\\uploads\\Classroom of the Elite - Volume 01 [Seven Seas][Kobo]\\images\\image10.jpg\"", "==============="], "Chapter 20": ["How could someone pour so much courage, determination, and compassion into so few words? That was no simple feat. The girl might have seemed like a nuisance to those around her, but she appealed to the other passengers earnestly and without fear. \n Though not in a priority seat, I was near the elderly woman. I imagined if I raised my hand and offered my spot, then the matter would be settled. \n However, like everyone else, I didn\u2019t move. None of us had thought it necessary to move. The boy\u2019s attitude and remarks aside, everyone on the bus had, for the most part, agreed with him. \n Now, of course, the elderly have undeniable worth to Japan. But we, the youth, will continue to support Japan into the future. Also, considering that our society ages more and more every year, you could say that our youthful value only increases. So, if you were to examine both the elderly and the young and ask yourself which group is more valuable, the answer should be obvious. That\u2019s really the perfect argument, wouldn\u2019t you say? \n But still, I wondered what the others would do. As I looked around, I saw two kinds of people: those who had pretended not to have heard anything and those who looked hesitant. \n However, the girl sitting next to me was different. She alone wasn\u2019t swept up by the confusion. Her face remained expressionless. \n While I unintentionally stared at her, our eyes met for an instant. Even without speaking a word, I could tell that we shared the same opinion. Neither of us considered it necessary to give up our seat. \n \u201cE-excuse me. You can have mine.\u201d Shortly after the girl\u2019s appeal, a working woman stood, unable to bear the guilt any longer, and offered up her seat. \n \u201cThank you very much!\u201d the elderly woman said. \n The working woman smiled, lowered her head, and guided the elderly woman to the now-vacant seat. \n The elderly woman expressed her gratitude repeatedly, and slowly sat. Watching the scene unfold from my peripheral vision, I crossed my arms and closed my eyes. Soon, we arrived at our destination, and all the high school students began to disembark. \n As I got off the bus, I saw a gate formed from natural rock waiting just ahead. All the young boys and girls dressed in school uniforms were passing through this gate. \n The Japanese government had created the Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School with the express purpose of developing future leaders. This would be my school from now on. \n Okay, stop for a moment. Take a deep breath. All right, here we go! \n \u201cWait!\u201d \n The instant I tried to take my first courageous step, someone called out to me. It was the girl who\u2019d sat next to me on the bus. \n \u201cYou were looking at me. Why?\u201d she asked. \n She narrowed her eyes while we spoke. \n \u201cSorry. I guess I was just interested, is all. I mean, you didn\u2019t think about giving up your seat to the old woman, did you?\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s right. I didn\u2019t consider giving it up. Is there something wrong with that?\u201d \n \u201cOh, no, not at all. I didn\u2019t intend to give up my seat, either. In fact, I firmly abide by the philosophy of letting sleeping dogs lie. I dislike trouble.\u201d \n \u201cYou dislike trouble? Then I don\u2019t think you and I are anything alike. I didn\u2019t give up my seat because I thought it would be pointless. That\u2019s all.\u201d \n \u201cBut doesn\u2019t that seem worse than just not liking trouble?\u201d \n \u201cPerhaps. I\u2019m simply acting according to my own beliefs. That\u2019s different from someone who just dislikes trouble, like you. I don\u2019t want to spend any time around people like you.\u201d \n \u201cI feel the same way,\u201d I muttered. \n I had only wanted to share my opinion, but I wasn\u2019t too keen on going back and forth with her like this. We both sighed and proceeded to walk in the same direction. \n "], "Chapter 21": ["==============="], "Chapter 22": ["2.2 \n I disliked the entrance ceremony and imagined that many first-year students probably felt the same. The principal and the students exchanged excessive words of gratitude, there was far too much time spent standing in lines, and, with so many irritating things to deal with, it all felt like a huge pain in the butt. But those weren\u2019t my only complaints. The entrance ceremonies for elementary school, junior high, and high school all mean the same thing: the start of another major trial for children. In order for students to enjoy their time at school, they must make friends, and there are only a few key days after the entrance ceremony to properly do that. Failure to do so signals the beginning of a rather tragic three years. \n As someone who dislikes trouble, I decided I\u2019d like to establish proper relationships. Unfamiliar with the notion, I\u2019d spent the day before in preparation, running through different scenarios. \n For instance, should I burst into the classroom and actively start talking to people? Should I secretly pass around a slip of paper with my email address, so as to better befriend someone? Someone like me needed to practice, because this environment was so different from what I\u2019d experienced thus far. I was completely isolated. I had ventured alone into a battlefield, and it was do or die. \n Looking around the classroom, I walked toward the seat that bore my nameplate. It was at the back of the room, near the window. A good place to sit, generally. As I looked around, I saw that the room was already halfway filled with students. The others were either immersed in their class materials or already talking with other people. Perhaps they\u2019d all been friends beforehand or had only recently gotten acquainted. Well then, what should I do? Take action during this free time and try to meet someone? In front of me, a rather rotund boy sat at his desk, hunching over. Perhaps it was my imagination, but he appeared lonely. \n The boy exuded an aura that seemed to shout, \u201cPlease, someone be my friend!\u201d However, if you just went up to someone and start talking, you might be bothering them. Should you wait for the right time? But then you might wait too long and be left friendless. I just had to\u2026 No, no, wait, I couldn\u2019t be hasty. If I started a thoughtless conversation with someone I didn\u2019t know, I ran the risk of making a serious social gaffe. \n Not good. I was trapped in a downward spiral. \n In the end, I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone at all. At the rate things were going, I\u2019d be completely alone. Had I heard someone say, \u201cIs he still all alone?\u201d Had I heard chuckling? Perhaps it was all in my head. What on earth are \u201cfriends,\u201d anyway? Where do friends come from? Do people become friends after sharing a meal together? Can you become friends with someone after you walk to the bathroom together for the first time? The more I thought about it, the more I wondered: What is friendship? Is it something deep and meaningful? I tried to piece it together. \n Trying to make friends is incredibly bothersome. Besides, don\u2019t human relationships tend to form naturally? My thoughts were in utter disarray, as though a raucously loud festival was being staged inside my head. While I sat lost in a haze, the classroom quickly filled. Fine. Whatever. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? After a long period of conflict, I finally began to rise from my seat. However\u2026 \n Before I knew it, the rotund, bespectacled boy in front of me had started to talk with another classmate. \n Wearing a bitter smile, I realized that there was no new friendship to be cultivated there. I\u2019m happy for you, Glasses-kun. It looks like you made your first friend. \n \u201cI got beaten to the punch!\u201d \n I was at my wit\u2019s end, stuck in useless navel-gazing. Reflexively, I let out a deep sigh. My high school experience seemed poised to be exceptionally dour. Then, someone sat down beside me. \n \u201cThat\u2019s quite a heavy sigh, considering the school year has only begun. Meeting you again makes me want to sigh.\u201d \n It was the girl who\u2019d fought with me at the bus stop and then walked off. \n \u201cSo, we were placed in the same class, huh?\u201d I mumbled. \n Well, there were only four classes for all of the first-year students, after all. Statistically, it wasn\u2019t impossible for us to be together. \n \u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Ayanokouji Kiyotaka.\u201d \n \u201cYou just went ahead and introduced yourself?\u201d she said. \n \u201cWell, this is the second time that we\u2019ve spoken. Isn\u2019t it fine for me to do so?\u201d \n I had wanted to introduce myself to someone anyway, so it wasn\u2019t as though I could just keep quiet. Besides, in order to become familiar with my class, I had to at least know my neighbor\u2019s name\u2026even if she was this audacious girl. \n \u201cDo you mind if I refuse?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cI don\u2019t think sitting next to someone for an entire year without knowing their name would be comfortable.\u201d \n \u201cI disagree.\u201d \n Shooting me a glance, she placed her bag on her desk. Apparently, she wasn\u2019t going to tell me her name. Lacking any interest in the classroom, the girl simply sat upright in her chair like a model student. \n \u201cDo you have a friend in another class? Or did you enroll here all on your lonesome?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cYou\u2019re a curious one, aren\u2019t you? You won\u2019t find talking to me very interesting, though.\u201d \n \u201cIf I\u2019m bothering you, you can just tell me to be quiet.\u201d \n I wouldn\u2019t introduce myself if it made her angry. I thought that the conversation was over, but then the girl sighed. Apparently, she\u2019d changed her mind. She turned her gaze on me and introduced herself. \n \u201cI\u2019m Horikita Suzune.\u201d \n For the first time, I got a good look at her face. \n Wow. She was cute. Or rather, she was beautiful. Even though we were in the same grade, I\u2019d have believed it if you told me she was a year or two older. \n Such a calm, cool beauty. \n \u201cLet me tell you about myself,\u201d I said. \u201cI have no particular hobbies, but I\u2019m interested in just about anything. I\u00a0don\u2019t need many friends, but I think it would be nice to have at least a few. And, well, that\u2019s about it.\u201d \n \u201cSpoken just like someone who avoids trouble. I don\u2019t think I could ever like such a person,\u201d she said. \n \u201cJeez, I feel like you trashed my entire existence in one second,\u201d I muttered. \n \u201cI pray this will be my only upset.\u201d \n \u201cI sympathize, but, unfortunately, I don\u2019t think your prayers will be answered.\u201d I pointed to the classroom entrance. Standing there was\u2014 \n \u201cThis seems like a rather well-equipped classroom. It would appear to live up to people\u2019s expectations, hmm?\u201d Yes. The boy who\u2019d quarreled with those women on the bus. \n \u201cI see. This certainly is bad luck,\u201d she said. \n This troublemaker had been placed in Class D with us. Without seeming to notice our presence at all, he went over to the seat labeled \u201cKouenji\u201d and sat. I wondered if such a person had ever considered even the idea of friendship. I tried observing him for a little bit. Kouenji put his feet on top of the desk, took a nail file from his bag, and hummed while he treated his fingernails. He acted as though he were completely alone. \n Apparently, the rude comments he\u2019d made on the bus had been an accurate reflection of his opinions. Within ten seconds, more than half the class had begun drawing away from Kouenji. His imposing nature dominated the space. Looking over, I saw that Horikita\u2019s gaze had lowered, and she seemed to be reading one of her own books. Oh, shoot. I\u2019d forgotten that conversational back-and-forth was one of the basics of maintaining interest. I\u2019d squashed one of my chances to become friends with Horikita. Leaning down, I glanced at the title of her book: Crime and Punishment . Now that was interesting. A story that debated whether it was right to kill someone, so long as it was done for the sake of justice. \n So sad. Perhaps Horikita\u2019s taste in books was reflected in her personality. Well, at any rate, we\u2019d introduced ourselves, so perhaps we could at least become neighborly. After a few minutes, the first bell rang. At that precise moment, a woman entered the classroom. When I first saw her, my initial impression was that she firmly believed in discipline. If I had to guess, I would have placed her age at thirty. She wore a suit and had delicate features. Her hair seemed long, and she\u2019d tied it into a ponytail. \n \u201cAhem. Good morning to you, students. I\u2019m the instructor for Class D. My name is Chiyabashira Sae. I usually teach Japanese history. However, at this school, we do not change classrooms for each grade. For the next three years, I will be acting as your homeroom teacher, so I hope to get to know all of you. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. The entrance ceremony will be in the gymnasium one hour from now, but first, I will distribute written materials with information about this school\u2019s special rules. I will also hand out the admissions guide.\u201d \n The students in the front seats passed back the familiar documents I\u2019d received after being accepted. \n This school differed from the multitude of other Japanese high schools in a few key ways. Here, all students were required to live in dormitories located on school premises. Also, except for special cases, such as studying abroad, students were forbidden to contact anyone outside the school. Even contact with your immediate family was forbidden without authorization. Naturally, leaving school grounds without permission was also strictly forbidden. \n However, the campus also came equipped with many excellent facilities. With its own karaoke spot, theater, caf\u00e9, boutique, and more, you could easily compare this school to a small city. The campus spread over more than 600,000 square meters. \n This school boasted another unique feature: the S System. \n \u201cI will now hand out your student ID cards. By using your card, you can access any of the facilities on campus, purchase goods from the store, and so on. It acts like a credit card. However, it is imperative that you pay attention to the points that you spend. At this school, you can use your points to buy anything. Anything located on the school premises is available for purchase.\u201d \n Our points, loaded onto our student ID cards, acted as a kind of currency. The lack of paper money would prevent many students\u2019 financial troubles. However, students needed to keep a watchful eye on their spending habits. At any rate, the school provided these points free of charge. \n \u201cYour student cards can be used simply by swiping them through the machine scanner. The method is simple, so you shouldn\u2019t get confused. Points are automatically deposited into your account on the first of every month. You should all have received 100,000 points already. Keep in mind that one point is worth one yen. No further explanation should be necessary.\u201d \n The classroom erupted. \n In other words, we had received a 100,000-yen monthly allowance from the school upon admission. I\u2019d expect nothing less from a massive institution run by the Japanese government. 100,000 yen is a rather large sum of money for a high schooler. \n \u201cShocked by the amount of points you\u2019ve been given? This school evaluates its students\u2019 talents. Everyone here has passed the entrance examination, which itself speaks to your value and potential. The amount you\u2019ve received reflects the evaluation of your worth. You can use your points without restraint. After graduation, however, all of your points return to the school. Because it\u2019s impossible to exchange your points for cash, there\u2019s no advantage to saving them. Once points have been deposited into your account, it\u2019s up to you how to spend them. Do as you like. In the event that you don\u2019t want to spend your points, you may transfer them to someone else. However, extorting money from your peers is not allowed. This school monitors bullying very carefully.\u201d \n As bewilderment spread among the students, Chiyabashira-sensei looked over the room. \n \u201cWell, it appears no one has any questions. I hope that you enjoy your time here as students.\u201d \n Many of my classmates could not hide their surprise at the large amount of points. \n \u201cThis school doesn\u2019t seem as strict as I thought,\u201d I muttered. \n I thought I was talking to myself, but Horikita looked in my direction. She must have imagined I was speaking to her. \n \u201cThis school is extremely lenient, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n Despite all of the restrictions, like being forced to live in the dormitories, being forbidden to leave the campus, and being prohibited from contacting anyone on the outside, no one here seemed to have any complaints. In fact, you might even say that we\u2019d been given such preferential treatment that it was like we\u2019d been transported to paradise. Of course, the Advanced Nurturing High School\u2019s most impressive statistic was its near 100 percent placement rate for students advancing into higher education or entering the workforce. \n This government-sponsored school\u2019s thorough guidance of its students hoped to ensure a better future. In fact, the school heavily advertised this. Many of its alumni went on to achieve fame. Typically, no matter how famous or impressive a school might be, the areas of specialization are limited. For example, one school might specialize in sports or in music. Another might focus on something related to computers. However, at this school, any student could hope to succeed, regardless of their field. \n Only this school had that kind of name-brand value. I\u2019d assumed that the atmosphere would be cutthroat, but the majority of students looked like typical kids. \n No, that wasn\u2019t quite right. After all, we\u2019d been capable enough to pass the entrance exam. If we could reach graduation day peacefully, without incident, then we would have achieved our goal\u2026 Was such a thing really possible, though? \n \u201cThis is almost too much preferential treatment. It\u2019s frightening.\u201d \n As Horikita spoke, I realized I felt the same way. We hardly knew anything about this school. It was as if a veil of mystery shrouded everything. Because a school like this could make any wishes a reality, I\u2019d thought some kind of risk would have to be involved. \n \u201cHey, hey! Do you want to check out a store with me on our way back? Let\u2019s do some shopping!\u201d one girl cried. \n \u201cSure. With this much, we can buy anything. I\u2019m so glad I got into this school!\u201d another said. \n Once the teacher was gone, the newly rich students began to grow restless. \n \u201cEveryone, can you please listen to me for a moment?\u201d \n A student with the air of an upstanding young man quickly raised his hand. His hair wasn\u2019t dyed. He looked like an honors student. Based on his appearance, I got the impression he wasn\u2019t a delinquent. \n \u201cStarting today, we\u2019re all going to be classmates. Therefore, I think it\u2019d be good for us to introduce ourselves and become friends as soon as possible. We still have some time until the entrance ceremony. What do you say?\u201d \n He\u2019d just done something incredible. The majority of students were lost in thought, unable to speak up. \n \u201cAgreed! After all, we still don\u2019t know a thing about each other, not even our names,\u201d someone shouted. \n After the ice had broken, the previously hesitant students began to speak. \n \u201cMy name\u2019s Hirata Yousuke. Back in junior high, lots of people called me Yousuke. Feel free to use my first name! I guess my hobby is sports in general, but I especially like soccer. I\u2019m planning on playing soccer here, too. Nice to meet you!\u201d \n Hirata had effortlessly introduced himself to the class. He seemed exceptionally brave. And he\u2019d talked about his love for soccer, too! His level of popularity must\u2019ve increased two, no, maybe four times. Why, the girl seated next to Hirata had hearts in her eyes! If someone like Hirata became our class\u2019s linchpin, I wondered if he\u2019d keep everyone honest and motivated until graduation. \n Someone like him would probably end up dating the cutest girl in class. That was how these things typically went. \n \u201cWell then, I\u2019d like everyone to introduce themselves, starting from the front. Is that okay?\u201d \n Although the girl at the head of the class looked a little bewildered, she quickly made up her mind and stood. Or rather, she\u2019d been pressured, in response to Hirata\u2019s words. \n \u201cM-my name is\u2026Inogashira Ko-Ko\u2026\u201d \n The girl, last name Inogashira, seemed to freeze during her introduction. Was she drawing a blank, or had she not considered what she was going to say beforehand? As her words halted, she paled. It was rare to see someone get so incredibly nervous. \n \u201cDo your best!\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t panic! It\u2019s okay!\u201d \n Kind words poured out of our classmates. But it seemed to have the opposite effect on the girl; the words stuck in the back of her throat. The silence continued for five seconds. Ten seconds. You could\u2019ve cut the tension with a knife. Some of the girls started giggling. Inogashira was paralyzed with fear. She couldn\u2019t move a muscle. Another girl spoke up. \n \u201cIt\u2019s okay to go slowly. Don\u2019t rush.\u201d \n Although it might seem kind, saying, \u201cDo your best!\u201d and, \u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d it actually conveys a completely different meaning. To someone who is extremely nervous, \u201cDo your best!\u201d and, \u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d can actually seem forceful, as if indicating she needs to match her classmates. On the other hand, saying, \u201cJust take things slowly. Don\u2019t rush,\u201d allows her to take things at her own pace. \n After that, the girl calmed down and regained her composure. She took a few small breaths and tried again. \n \u201cMy name is Inogashira\u2026Kokoro. Um, my hobby is sewing. I\u2019m pretty good at knitting. I-It\u2019s nice to meet you all.\u201d \n She was able to finish without stopping. Looking alternately relieved, delighted, and embarrassed, Inogashira sat down. Other introductions followed hers. \n \u201cI\u2019m Yamauchi Haruki. I competed in table tennis during elementary school, and in junior high I was the ace player on our baseball team. I was number four. I got hurt during the inter-high school championships, though, and I\u2019m undergoing rehab now. Nice to meet you.\u201d \n I didn\u2019t think that the number of his baseball uniform was essential information\u2026 \n Besides, I\u2019d thought the inter-high championship was a national sports competition for high school students. Junior high school kids were supposed to be ineligible. \n Was he trying to crack a joke? He seemed like a talkative guy who got carried away pretty easily. \n \u201cWell then, I\u2019m next, aren\u2019t I?\u201d \n The cheerful girl who stood up was the same one who\u2019d told Inogashira to go slowly and calm down. She was also the same girl who\u2019d helped out the elderly woman on the bus that morning. \n \u201cMy name is Kushida Kikyou. None of my friends from junior high made it to this school, so I\u2019m alone here. I\u2019d like to get to know all of your names and faces right away and become friends as soon as possible!\u201d \n While most of the students had only said a few words of introduction, Kushida continued to talk. \n \u201cMy first goal is to become friends with everyone. So, after we\u2019re finished with introductions, I\u2019d love for you to share your contact information with me!\u201d \n She wasn\u2019t just saying that. I could tell right away that this girl was the type to open up her heart to anyone. \n Her encouraging words to Inogashira hadn\u2019t been platitudes, but a genuine reflection of her feelings. \n \u201cSo, after school or during vacations, I want to make all sorts of memories with lots of people. Please feel free to invite me to lots and lots of events! Anyway, I\u2019ve talked for a long time, so I\u2019ll end my introduction here.\u201d \n "], "Chapter 23": ["==============="], "Chapter 24": [" filename=\"static\\uploads\\Classroom of the Elite - Volume 01 [Seven Seas][Kobo]\\images\\image11.jpg\"", "==============="], "Chapter 25": ["She said it as though she knew I\u2019d been critiquing everyone\u2019s introductions. I felt strangely uncomfortable, and I wasn\u2019t sure why. \n What should I say when my turn came? Should I make a joke? Should I go into it with really high energy in order to get some laughs? No, that wouldn\u2019t work. Going out of control would just ruin the atmosphere. Besides, that didn\u2019t really fit my personality anyway. \n The introductions continued while I wrestled with my anxiety. \n \u201cWell then, next up is\u2026\u201d \n As Hirata looked encouragingly toward the next student, that student glared back. His hair was dyed a fiery red. He both looked and sounded like a delinquent. \n \u201cWhat, are we a bunch of little kids or something? I don\u2019t need to introduce myself. People who want to do that can go ahead. Just leave me out of it.\u201d \n The red-haired guy scowled at Hirata. He had quite a presence, his attitude intense and overpowering. \n \u201cI can\u2019t force you to introduce yourself, of course. However, I don\u2019t think that getting along with your classmates is a bad thing. If I\u2019ve made you uncomfortable, I apologize.\u201d \n When Hirata bowed his head, some of the girls glared at the guy with red hair. \n \u201cIsn\u2019t it fine to introduce yourself?\u201d one of them snapped. \n \u201cYeah, yeah!\u201d \n As I\u2019d expected, the pretty-boy soccer star had captured most of the girls\u2019 hearts in the blink of an eye. However, half of the male students started to look angry, probably out of jealousy. \n \u201cShut it. I don\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t come here to make friends.\u201d The guy with red hair got up from his seat. It seemed he had no intention of getting to know anyone. Several other students followed suit and left the classroom together. Horikita got up and briefly glanced my way. When she realized I wasn\u2019t moving, she started to walk out the door. Hirata looked a little lonely when he saw Horikita head out. \n \u201cThey\u2019re not a bad bunch. It\u2019s my fault. I was being selfish and made people do this.\u201d \n \u201cNo way. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, Hirata-kun. Let\u2019s just leave those guys be, okay?\u201d \n Although some people had rebelled at the idea of introductions, the students who remained were happy to continue. In the end, things wrapped up in a rather ordinary fashion. \n \u201cI\u2019m Ike Kanji. I love girls, and I hate pretty boys. I\u2019m currently in the market for a new girlfriend. It\u2019s nice to meet you! All the better if you\u2019re a cutie or a beauty!\u201d \n It was difficult to tell if he was joking or not. At the very least, the girls looked at him with revulsion. \n \u201cWow. You are so cool, Ike-kun,\u201d one girl said, in a completely emotionless voice. Of course, her statement was 1000 percent false. \n \u201cSeriously? Seriously? Oh, man. I mean, I thought that I wasn\u2019t bad or anything, but\u2026heh heh.\u201d \n Apparently, Ike thought that she was being serious. He blushed. Instantly, the girls started to laugh. \n \u201cOh, wow. He\u2019s cute , huh, everyone? He\u2019s looking for a girlfriend!\u201d \n Dude, they\u2019re making fun of you. Ike continued to jovially go along with the teasing. He didn\u2019t seem like a bad guy, though. \n Next up was the combative boy from the bus, Kouenji. While inspecting his bangs in a hand mirror, he combed his hair. \n \u201cExcuse me, can you introduce yourself?\u201d Hirata asked. \n \u201cHmph. Fine.\u201d \n He smirked like an aristocrat, displaying his impudent attitude. As he shifted in his seat, I thought he might leave, but Kouenji placed both of his legs on his desk and introduced himself. \n \u201cMy name is Kouenji Rokusuke. As the sole male heir to the Kouenji conglomerate group, I will soon be tasked with carrying Japan into the future. I sincerely look forward to making your acquaintance, ladies.\u201d \n He aimed his introduction solely at the opposite sex, rather than the entire class. After hearing that he was rich, some of the girls looked at him with sparkling eyes, while others regarded Kouenji as if he were nothing more than a weirdo. That was only natural. \n \u201cStarting today, I will mercilessly punish anyone who makes me uncomfortable. Please exercise proper precaution so that you may avoid that.\u201d \n \u201cUm, Kouenji-kun. What exactly do you mean when you say, \u2018anyone who makes me uncomfortable\u2019?\u201d asked Hirata, who looked uneasy at the word \u201cpunish.\u201d \n \u201cI meant exactly what I said. If asked to give an example, well\u2026 I would say I hate ugly things, for instance. So, if I saw something ugly, I would do just as I said.\u201d \n Fwish! He flipped his long, flowing bangs. \n \u201cAh, thank you. I will be careful then.\u201d \n There was the guy with red hair, Horikita, Kouenji, Yamauchi, and Ike. Apparently, this class was full of people with bizarre idiosyncrasies. \n I, too, was especially peculiar, in that there was nothing peculiar about me. I had wanted to be free, free as a bird, but prior to this I\u2019d languished in a cage. I had wanted to fly into the expansive open skies. If you looked out the window, you could watch birds gracefully soaring\u2026 Well, not right now, but in general. Anyway, that\u2019s the kind of guy I was. \n \u201cWell then, time for the next person. Can you please introduce yourself?\u201d \n \u201cHuh?\u201d \n Oh, shoot. My turn had come while I\u2019d been daydreaming. Students turned, waiting for my introduction. Hey, hey! Don\u2019t look at me with so much anticipation. Oh well, I might as well try my best . \n Clack! The chair rattled as I stood. \n \u201cUm. Well, my name is Ayanokouji Kiyotaka. And, uh, I don\u2019t really have any special skills or anything. I\u2019ll do my best to get along with all of you. It\u2019s, uh, nice to meet you.\u201d \n Well? Was that my introduction? \n I\u2019d failed! \n I instinctively buried my head in my hands. I hadn\u2019t had time to construct a proper introduction because I\u2019d been too busy daydreaming. It was the worst possible intro. It didn\u2019t attract attention, and absolutely no one would remember it. \n \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Ayanokouji-kun. I always want to be friends with everyone, just like you. Let\u2019s both do our best, okay?\u201d Hirata responded with a refreshing smile. \n Everyone clapped. Their applause felt somewhat like pity, which strangely pained me. Despite that, however, I felt kind of glad. \n "], "Chapter 26": ["==============="], "Chapter 27": ["2.3 \n E ven though people said this place was tough, the entrance ceremony was the same as any other school\u2019s. Some important people offered words of thanks, and the ceremony concluded without incident. Then, it was noon. After we received some general information about the campus, the crowd dispersed. \n 70\u201380 percent of the students headed toward the dormitories. The remaining students quickly formed into groups. Some made their way to caf\u00e9s, while the louder ones went out for karaoke. The hustle and bustle quickly died down. On a whim, I decided to swing by the convenience store on my way back to the dormitory. Of course, I went alone. I didn\u2019t have a chaperone, or acquaintance, or anyone like that. \n \u201cMy, what an unpleasant coincidence.\u201d \n Entering the convenience store, I ran into Horikita once again. \n \u201cCome on, there\u2019s no need to be so hostile. Anyway, did you need to buy something?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cYes, just a few things. I came to get some necessities.\u201d \n There was no shortage of things you needed when starting life in a dorm, especially if you were a girl. Horikita took various necessities like shampoo off the shelves and promptly threw them into the basket she was carrying. I\u2019d thought she would choose higher quality items, but she only took the cheapest options. \n \u201cI thought girls usually made a fuss over what kind of shampoo they bought.\u201d \n \u201cWell, that depends on the person, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019m the sort who doesn\u2019t know when you might need money,\u201d she replied. \n She shot me an icy glare that seemed to say, Could you please not inspect other people\u2019s purchases without their permission? \n \u201cAt any rate, I was terribly surprised that you stayed for introductions,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t look like the type to hang out with a circle of classmates.\u201d \n \u201cI decided to participate precisely because I don\u2019t like trouble. Why didn\u2019t you introduce yourself to them, Horikita? You could have gotten to know several other students, and it would have been a chance to make friends.\u201d \n Quite a few of the students had exchanged cell numbers, too. If Horikita had participated, she would probably have become quite popular. What a waste. \n \u201cThere are several reasons why I objected, but I suppose it might be better if I simply explain, hmm? My introduction might have sown discord, depending on how things went. Thus, doing nothing avoided creating more problems. Am I wrong?\u201d \n \u201cBut, statistically speaking, there was a high probability that you could have hit it off with everyone after introducing yourself,\u201d I said. \n \u201cHow did you arrive at that conclusion? Actually, if I argue this with you now, we\u2019ll just end up in an endless debate. Let\u2019s say that the probability of making friends was high, like you said. So, how many people did you get to know?\u201d \n \u201cUgh\u2026\u201d \n She gazed at me. \n That was a rather splendid argument. The fact that I hadn\u2019t yet exchanged contact information with anyone worked in Horikita\u2019s favor. It proved there was no guarantee that introductions led to friendship. I instinctively averted my eyes. \n \u201cIn other words, you have no evidence to support your claim that self-introductions lead to making friends, do you?\u201d she asked. \u201cBesides, I never intended to make friends in the first place. If I have no need to introduce myself, then I also have no reason to listen to anyone else\u2019s introductions. Have I convinced you?\u201d \n That reminded me of the disastrous first time I\u2019d tried to introduce myself to Horikita. Come to think of it, it might have been a miracle that I\u2019d managed to get her name. \n When I asked her if I shouldn\u2019t have introduced myself to her, she shook her head. People tended to have hidden depths, no doubt about it. Horikita might have been a more solitary, more aloof person than I\u2019d imagined. \n We roamed around the convenience store without looking at each other. Even though she was somewhat uptight, being with her didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable. \n \u201cWhoa! There\u2019s even an amazing selection of noodle cups here! This school is super convenient!\u201d \n Two rather noisy male students stood before the instant foods. They tossed a veritable mountain of noodle cups into their basket and made their way to the cash register. Besides noodles, they\u2019d stocked up on snacks and juice. Hey, it\u2019d be nearly impossible to go through all your points; better to spend them. \n \u201cNoodle cups. They have so many kinds.\u201d \n These were definitely one reason I\u2019d come to the convenience store. \n \u201cSo, do boys really like this kind of stuff? I can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s healthy,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cI like them just fine, I guess.\u201d \n I picked up a noodle cup and examined the price tag. It said 156 yen, but I couldn\u2019t tell whether that was expensive or cheap. Even though the school referred to its credit system as points, the prices were all listed in yen. \n \u201cHey, what do you think? Is this price high or low?\u201d \n \u201cHmm. I\u2019m not sure. Why, is there something curious about it?\u201d \n \u201cNo, I was just wondering.\u201d \n The store\u2019s prices seemed reasonable. One point appeared to really equal one yen. Given that the average freshman\u2019s allowance was around 5,000 yen, the amount of money we\u2019d received seemed impossibly large. Horikita, noting my odd behavior, gave me a quizzical look. I grabbed a noodle cup to avoid suspicion. \n \u201cWow, this is enormous. It\u2019s a G Cup, huh?\u201d \n Apparently, that stood for \u201cGiga Cup.\u201d Just looking at it made me feel full. On an unrelated note, Horikita\u2019s breasts were neither small nor huge. They exquisitely straddled the line between the two. The perfect size. \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun. Were you thinking about something stupid just now?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cEr. No?\u201d \n \u201cI felt like you were acting strangely.\u201d \n She could sense my inappropriate thoughts just by looking at me. She was a sharp one. \n \u201cI was just wondering whether or not I should buy this. What do you think?\u201d \n \u201cOh. Well, I suppose that\u2019s fine. Anyway, do you really think you should buy that? This school offers far healthier food options. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s better to avoid eating junk?\u201d \n Like Horikita said, I had no reason to eat junk. However, since I had an irresistible urge, I took one package of regular-sized instant noodles with \u201cFOO Yakisoba\u201d written on it and tossed it into my cart. Her attention wandering, Horikita moved away from the food and began hunting for daily essentials. I planned to use witty jokes to score more points with her next. \n \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for something a cut above the rest , how about this razor with five blades? I bet it\u2019d do the job.\u201d \n \u201cWhy in the world would I want to shave with that ?\u201d \n I grinned smugly and pretended to shave an imaginary beard, but she didn\u2019t laugh. Far from it. Instead, she looked at me like I was dirt. \n \u201cLook at me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to shave. Not on my chin, not under my armpits, and not down there .\u201d \n I mumbled hesitantly, my spirit crushed. It looked like my jokes failed colossally with women. \n \u201cI have to say, I\u2019m a little envious of your ability to babble inanely to someone you\u2019ve only just met.\u201d \n \u201cWell, I feel like you\u2019ve been saying stupid crap, too, and you only just met me .\u201d \n \u201cIs that so? I\u2019ve merely stated facts. Unlike you.\u201d She calmly tossed my words back at me, shutting me up. To be fair, I had said some random nonsense. The smooth, eloquent Horikita, on the other hand, was always well-spoken, no matter how you sliced it. \n Horikita chose the cheapest face wash. I would have thought girls cared more about that kind of thing, too. \n \u201cDon\u2019t you think that this one is better?\u201d I took an expensive cream off the shelf and showed it to her. \n \u201cUnnecessary.\u201d She refused it. \n \u201cWell, but\u2014\u201d \n \u201cI already said it was unnecessary, didn\u2019t I?\u201d she snapped. \n \u201cYes\u2026\u201d \n I gently returned the face wash as she glared at me. I thought I could carry on a conversation without making her angry, but I\u2019d failed. \n \u201cYou don\u2019t seem adept at socializing. You\u2019re terrible at conversation.\u201d \n \u201cWell, if it\u2019s coming from you, then it\u2019s definitely true,\u201d I grumbled. \n \u201cThat\u2019s right. I consider myself, at the very least, to have a good eye for people. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t want to hear you talk anymore, but I will put in a painful level of effort to listen to you.\u201d \n I\u2019d said that I wanted to be her friend, but, apparently, she didn\u2019t feel the same. With that, our conversation abruptly stopped. Two new girls entered the convenience store. It was a little strange, but I became aware of something crucial: Horikita really was cute. \n \u201cHey. What\u2019s up with this?\u201d \n While looking around the store, desperate for a new topic, I\u2019d found something strange. Some toiletries and food had been tucked away in the corner of the convenience store. At first glance, they appeared to be the same as the other items, but there was one big difference. \n \u201cFree?\u201d \n Horikita apparently also thought it strange, so she picked up one of the items. Daily necessities like toothbrushes and bandages had been stuffed into a clearance bin and labeled \u201cFree.\u201d The bin was also marked with the proviso \u201cthree items per month.\u201d These were obviously different from the store\u2019s other goods. \n \u201cThey must be emergency relief supplies for students who use up their points. This school is so incredibly lenient,\u201d I said. \n I had to wonder how far their leniency extended, though. \n \u201cHey, shut it! Just wait a sec! I\u2019m looking for it right now!\u201d \n A sudden, loud voice drowned out the store\u2019s peaceful background music. \n \u201cCome on, hurry up. You have a line of people waiting on you!\u201d \n \u201cOh, yeah? Well, if they have any complaints, they can take it up with me!\u201d \n Apparently, trouble was brewing by the register. A dispute had broken out between two young men who were glaring at each other. I recognized the one with the thoroughly ill-tempered look on his face. It was the student from my class, the guy with the red hair. He had his hands full of noodle cups. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cHuh? Who are you ?\u201d \n I had meant to appear amicable, but the guy with red hair scowled at me. Apparently, he was under the mistaken impression that I was an enemy. \n \u201cMy name\u2019s Ayanokouji. I\u2019m from your class. I just asked because it sounded like there was trouble.\u201d \n At my explanation, the red-haired guy looked somewhat mollified and lowered his voice a little. \u201cOh. Yeah, I remember you. I forgot my student ID card. Forgot that it pretty much acts as our money from now on, too.\u201d \n I looked at his empty hands. He\u2019d put the noodle cups away. He started to leave, probably heading back to the dorms, where he\u2019d likely forgotten his card. To be honest, the fact that the student ID was necessary for payment hadn\u2019t yet sunk in for me, either. \n \u201cI can pay for you. I mean, it\u2019d be annoying if you had to head all the way back to the dorms. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s true. You\u2019re right, it\u2019d be absolutely annoying. Thanks.\u201d \n The store wasn\u2019t particularly far from the dorms, but by the time he got back there would be a long line of students buying lunch. \n \u201cMy name\u2019s Sudou,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks for helping me out. I owe you.\u201d \n \u201cNice to meet you, Sudou.\u201d \n Sudou handed me his noodle cup, and I walked over to the hot water dispenser. After watching our short exchange, Horikita sighed, aghast. \n \u201cYou\u2019re acting like a pushover right from the start. Do you intend to become his servant? Or are you doing this to make friends?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cI didn\u2019t care about making friends. I just wanted to help. No big deal.\u201d \n \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be afraid.\u201d \n \u201cAfraid? Why? Because he looks like a delinquent?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cA normal person would try to keep someone like him at a distance.\u201d \n \u201cI guess, but he doesn\u2019t seem like a bad person to me. And you don\u2019t appear to be scared either, Horikita.\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s mostly defenseless people who stay away from those types. If he acted violently, I could rebuff him. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t withdraw.\u201d \n Horikita\u2019s words were always a little difficult to understand. To begin with, what did she mean by \u201crebuff\u201d? Did she carry pepper spray to keep off perverts or something? \n \u201cLet\u2019s finish our shopping. We\u2019ll be a bother to the other students if we dawdle,\u201d she said. \n Wrapping things up, we presented our student ID cards to the machine by the register. Since we didn\u2019t have to deal with small change, our transaction was speedy. \n \u201cYou really can use it like money\u2026\u201d I said. \n My receipt showed the price of each item and the remaining amount of points. The payment had gone through without any problems. I poured hot water into my noodle cup while waiting for Horikita. I\u2019d thought it might be tricky, but opening the lid and pouring hot water up to the line was simple enough. \n Anyway, this school was eerie. \n What merit could every student possibly have that would warrant such a massive allowance? Considering that there were about 160 people enrolled in my grade, simple calculation suggested that there were 480 people total in this school. That alone would mean 48 million yen each month. Annually, that would equal 560 million yen. Even for a government-supported school, that seemed like overkill. \n \u201cHow does the school benefit from giving us this much money?\u201d \n \u201cI wonder. The campus has more than enough facilities for the number of students, and I wouldn\u2019t think it necessary to hand out so much. Students who should be studying might slack off.\u201d \n Perhaps it was some kind of reward for working hard and passing a test or something. Indeed, student motivation might increase if offered an incentive. However, the school had just handed out 100,000 yen to everyone, with no strings attached. \n \u201cI won\u2019t tell you what to do, but I think it would be best to avoid wasting your money. It\u2019s difficult to fix frivolous spending habits. Once a person gets used to an easy life, they find they need more and more. When you lose it, the shock can be great,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d \n I didn\u2019t really intend to waste money on miscellaneous junk, but she had a point. After paying and exiting the store, I found Sudou seated outside, waiting for me. When I saw him, he gently waved me over. I waved in return, feeling somewhat embarrassed, yet happy. \n \u201cAre you really going to eat here?\u201d I asked him. \n \u201cOf course. It\u2019s just common sense.\u201d \n Sudou perplexed me with his matter-of-fact reply. Horikita sighed in exasperation. \n \u201cI\u2019m going back. I\u2019ll be stripped of my dignity if I spend more time here,\u201d she said. \n \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018dignity\u2019? We\u2019re just high school students. We\u2019re ordinary. Or, what, are you the high-born daughter of some noble family or something?\u201d \n Horikita didn\u2019t flinch at Sudou\u2019s harsh tone. Seemingly irritated, Sudou set his noodle cup on the ground and stood. \n \u201cHuh? Hey, listen to people when they\u2019re talking to you! Hey!\u201d he said. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s his problem? He just suddenly got angry.\u201d Horikita said this to me, ignoring Sudou. This was apparently too much for Sudou, who started to shout. \n \u201cHey, get over here! I\u2019ll smack that smug look off your face!\u201d he yelled. \n \u201cLook, I\u2019ll admit that Horikita has a bad attitude, but you\u2019re taking this too far.\u201d \n It was apparent that Sudou\u2019s patience had run out. \u201cHuh? What was that? She has a bratty, obnoxious attitude. That\u2019s bad, especially for a girl!\u201d \n \u201cFor a girl? That\u2019s rather outdated thinking. Ayanokouji, I would advise you not to become his friend,\u201d Horikita said. With that, she turned her back on Sudou. \n \u201cHey, wait! You shitty girl!\u201d \n \u201cCalm down.\u201d I held Sudou back as he actually tried to grab Horikita. She made her way in the direction of the dorms without stopping or glancing back. \n \u201cWhat the hell is her deal? Goddamn it!\u201d he shouted. \n \u201cThere are many different types of people, you know.\u201d \n \u201cShut it. I hate those stuffy, too-serious types.\u201d \n He continued to glare at me. Sudou grabbed his noodle cup once again, ripped off the cover, and began eating. Just a little while ago, he\u2019d fought in front of the register, too. He probably had a short fuse. \n \u201cHey, you guys first years? This is our spot.\u201d \n As Sudou slurped his ramen, three boys called out to us. They seemed to have come out of the same store and were carrying the same brand of noodle cups. \n \u201cWho are you ? I was already here. You\u2019re in the way. Get lost,\u201d Sudou barked. \n \u201cYou hear this guy? \u2018Get lost,\u2019 he says. What a cocky little first-year punk.\u201d \n The three laughed in Sudou\u2019s face. Sudou shot up, slamming his noodle cup against the ground. The broth and noodles splashed everywhere. \n \u201c\u2018First-year punk,\u2019 huh? You tryin\u2019 to make fun of me, huh?!\u201d \n Sudou had an extremely short fuse. If I had to judge, he seemed like the type to immediately threaten anyone or anything that crossed him. \n \u201cYou\u2019re awfully mouthy, considering we\u2019re second-year students. We already put our bags here, see?\u201d \n Plop ! With those words, the second-year upperclassmen students put down their bags and guffawed loudly. \n \u201cSee, our stuff\u2019s here. Now, beat it,\u201d one of them said. \n \u201cYou got a lot of guts, asshole.\u201d \n Sudou didn\u2019t back down, unfazed by being outnumbered. It looked like fists were going to fly at any moment. I, of course, didn\u2019t want any part of it myself. \n \u201cOh, wow, scary. What class are you in? Wait, never mind. I think I know. You\u2019re in Class D, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n \u201cYeah, so what?\u201d Sudou snapped. \n The upperclassmen students exchanged glances and burst into laughter. \n \u201cYou hear that? He\u2019s in Class D! I knew it! It was a dead giveaway!\u201d \n \u201cHuh? What\u2019s that supposed to mean? Hey!\u201d \n As Sudou barked at them, the boys grinned and stepped backwards. \n \u201cAw, you poor things. Since you\u2019re \u2018defective,\u2019 we\u2019ll let you off the hook, just for today. Let\u2019s get going, guys.\u201d \n \u201cHey, don\u2019t run away! Hey!\u201d Sudou shouted. \n \u201cYeah, yeah, keep on yapping. You guys\u2019ll be in hell soon enough anyway.\u201d \n Be in hell? \n They appeared calm and composed. I wondered what they\u2019d meant. Previously, I\u2019d been certain this school would be filled with upper-class young men and women, but there seemed to be plenty of rowdy, combative people like Sudou or those upperclassmen. \n \u201cAh, damn it! If those had been nice second-year students, or cute girls, that would\u2019ve been great. Instead, we had to deal with those annoying morons.\u201d \n Sudou didn\u2019t bother to clean up his mess. He thrust his hands into his pockets before heading back. I looked at the wall outside the convenience store, discovering two surveillance cameras. \n \u201cThis might lead to problems later,\u201d I muttered. \n Reluctantly, I bent down, picked up the cup, and started cleaning up the mess. Come to think of it, as soon as those second-year students found out Sudou was in Class D, their attitudes had changed. Although it ate at me, I couldn\u2019t explain it. \n "], "Chapter 28": ["==============="], "Chapter 29": ["2.4 \n A round one pm, I made my way back to the dormitory, my home from that day onward. At the reception desk, I received a keycard for Room 401 and a handbook containing information about the dorm\u2019s rules, then boarded the elevator. I quickly flipped through the handbook, which only detailed the most basic things that we needed for our daily routines. The dates and times for garbage disposal were listed, as well as a notice about avoiding excessive noise. I also saw notes about not wasting water or electricity, and so on. \n \u201cSo, they don\u2019t place restrictions on electricity or gas usage?\u201d \n I\u2019d assumed that the school would deduct the cost from our points. This school really went to great lengths to have a perfect system for its students. However, I was a little surprised that they\u2019d implemented co-ed dormitories. After all, this was a high school, so the rules stated that unsuitable romantic relationships were frowned upon. In short, sex was strictly forbidden\u2026obviously. I mean, a member of the clergy wouldn\u2019t say that engaging in illicit sexual activity was okay. \n While I privately doubted that such pampered students could develop into fine, upstanding adults, it would be wise to make the best of the situation for now. My room was about eight tatami mats wide. Also, though this was a dorm, it was the first time I\u2019d lived alone. I refused to have any contact with the outside world until graduation. Considering my situation, I unintentionally cracked a smile. \n This school boasted a high employment rate upon graduation, and its facilities and student services were unmatched throughout the country, making it the preeminent high school in Japan. I found such things trivial, however. I\u2019d chosen this school for one fundamental reason. \n At this high school, people were not allowed to contact students without permission, even if they were friends or immediate family. I greatly appreciated that. I was free. In English, they would call it, \u201cfreedom.\u201d In French, they would call it, \u201clibert\u00e9.\u201d \n Isn\u2019t freedom simply the best? When I wanted to eat something, I could eat it. I almost didn\u2019t want to graduate. Before being accepted, I\u2019d honestly thought I would be been fine either way, that the difference between passing and failing would have been trivial. But my true feelings finally welled up. I was glad to have been admitted here. \n No one else\u2019s eyes or words would ever reach me. I could start ag\u2014no. I could begin anew entirely. A new life. I resolved to enjoy my time here to the fullest, but without drawing attention to myself. Still in my uniform, I dived into my already-made bed. I felt far from tired, however. I was so incredibly excited about my new life that I was unable to calm down. My eyes remained wide open. \n "], "Chapter 30": ["==============="], "Chapter 31": ["Chapter 3: The Students of Class D \n O n our second day of school\u2014well, I suppose technically it was the first day of class\u2014we spent most of our time running over the course objectives. Apparently, many of the students were quite surprised, if not a little disappointed, by how genuinely warm and friendly the teachers at this school looked. Sudou had already made a spectacle of himself by spending most of the class asleep. I thought that the teachers would notice, but they showed no signs of doing so. After all, it was up to every individual student whether or not he or she wanted to listen in class. I wondered if this was how teachers typically interacted with students once they left compulsory education. \n I took in the relaxed atmosphere, and soon it was lunchtime. Students stood up and left with their new acquaintances, disappearing from my view. I couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly envious as I watched them. Unfortunately, I still hadn\u2019t managed to befriend a single one of my new classmates. \n \u201cHow pathetic.\u201d \n Only one person had noticed how I felt, and she met my pain with derisive laughter. \n \u201cWhat? What\u2019s pathetic?\u201d I asked. \n \u201c\u2018I want someone to invite me along. I want to eat with someone!\u2019 Your thoughts are like an open book,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cBut you\u2019re alone, too, aren\u2019t you? Haven\u2019t you thought the same thing? Or do you intend to spend three years here without making a single friend?\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s right. I prefer to be alone,\u201d she replied quickly, without hesitation. It sounded like she was being honest. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop worrying about me and instead think about yourself?\u201d \n \u201cWell, I\u2026\u201d \n I certainly wasn\u2019t proclaiming my intention to be social. Honestly, at the rate things were going I might be unable to make any friends, spelling trouble for my future. I\u2019d likely end up alone again, and that would make me stand out. It could make me a target for bullying. \n Less than a minute after the end-of-class bell rang, about half of the students had disappeared. Those who remained either secretly wanted to go, like me, were unconscious of their surroundings, or preferred being alone, like Horikita. \n \u201cWell, I was thinking of heading to the cafeteria. Anyone want to come with me?\u201d announced Hirata as he stood. He was clearly one of those all-around good guys. I had to take my hat off to him. In my heart of hearts, I\u2019d been waiting for a savior to bestow a chance like this upon me. Yes, Hirata, I will go with you. I slowly tried to raise my hand, and\u2026 \n \u201cI\u2019ll go, too!\u201d \n \u201cMe, too! Me too!\u201d \n Girls gathered around Hirata one after another, and I lowered my hand. Why did those girls have to take his offer? This could\u2019ve been my chance to make friends with Hirata! You don\u2019t need to jump all over him for lunch just because he\u2019s kind of handsome! \n \u201cHow tragic.\u201d \n Horikita\u2019s derisive laugh morphed into scorn. \n \u201cDon\u2019t just assume you know what I\u2019m thinking,\u201d I said. \n \u201cDoes anyone else want to come?\u201d \n Hirata looked around the room, possibly feeling a bit lonely because no other boys had joined him. Hirata scanned the classroom, and his eyes met mine. Over here! Notice me, Hirata! There\u2019s someone here who wants an invitation! Hirata didn\u2019t avert his eyes, just as I would expect from someone with a handle on his life who cared about the people in his class! He understood my appeal! \n \u201cHey, Ayano\u2014\u201d \n Hirata began to call my name, but in that instant\u2014 \n \u201cCome on. Hurry up, Hirata-kun!\u201d \n A fashionista-type girl latched onto Hirata\u2019s arm. Ah\u2026 The girls stole Hirata\u2019s attention. They left the classroom together, all looking rather happy. I remained alone with my arm outstretched. Somewhat embarrassed, I tried to play it off by pretending to scratch my head. \n \u201cWell then.\u201d Horikita shot me another pitying look before departing the classroom, leaving me alone. \n \u201cThat was pointless.\u201d \n Reluctantly, I got up and decided to head toward the cafeteria by myself. If I didn\u2019t feel like I could eat alone in there, I\u2019d just score some supplies from the convenience store. \n \u201cYou\u2019re Ayanokouji-kun, right?\u201d \n On my way out, a beautiful girl suddenly called my name. It was Kushida, one of my classmates. This was the first time I\u2019d actually taken a good look at her, and it caused my heart to start pounding in my chest like a jackhammer. She had short, straight, dyed-brown hair that almost brushed the tops of her shoulders. While it certainly wasn\u2019t crude, the school had recently approved rather short skirt lengths. I had a strong feeling that this was one of the more recent uniforms. \n She was holding something in her hand. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was a pouch with a lot of key holders or what. \n \u201cI\u2019m Kushida, from your class. Do you remember me?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cYeah, kinda. Do you need something?\u201d \n \u201cTo tell you the truth, there\u2019s something I wanted to ask you. It\u2019s just one little question. Ayanokouji-kun, are you on good terms with Horikita-san?\u201d \n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t really say we\u2019re on good terms. Just casual acquaintances, I guess. Did she do something?\u201d \n It looked like her business was with Horikita rather than me, which was a little disappointing. \n \u201cOh, no. Well, do you remember when I said I wanted to get along with everyone in class? That\u2019s why I wanted everyone\u2019s contact info. But\u2026Horikita turned me down.\u201d \n Ugh. Horikita was so oblivious. If such a positive, outgoing girl asked for your info, it would\u2019ve been nice for you to throw me a bone and give me her contact info while you were at it. I could probably have gotten to know everyone in the class in almost no time at all. \n \u201cWeren\u2019t you two talking outside the school on the day of the entrance ceremony?\u201d \n Considering we\u2019d all ridden the bus together, it was no wonder that she\u2019d seen my meeting with Horikita. \n \u201cI was just wondering what kind of person Horikita-san is,\u201d Kushida continued. \u201cIs she the type who\u2019ll talk a lot when she\u2019s with a friend?\u201d \n She seemed to want information on Horikita, but I couldn\u2019t give her any answers. \n \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s very good at interacting with others. Why are you asking about Horikita, anyway?\u201d \n \u201cWell, during our introductions, Horikita-san walked out of the classroom, right? It seems like she hasn\u2019t talked to anybody yet, so I\u2019m a little worried about her.\u201d \n Kushida had said that she wanted to get along with everyone when she introduced herself. \n \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying, but I only just met her yesterday. I can\u2019t really help you.\u201d \n \u201cHmm. I see. I thought that you two must have been old friends before starting school here. I\u2019m sorry to have asked you such a strange question.\u201d \n \u201cOh, no, it\u2019s all right. Anyway, how did you know my name?\u201d \n \u201cHow? You introduced yourself the other day, didn\u2019t you? I remembered.\u201d \n Kushida had listened to my hopelessly lame self-introduction. Somehow, that made me really happy. \n \u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to meet you again, Ayanokouji-kun,\u201d she said. \n Although I was a little bewildered by her outstretched hand, I wiped my palms on my pants and shook hands with her. \n \u201cYeah, nice to meet you,\u201d I said. \n Today was probably my lucky day. Even though there\u2019d been some low points, some things had gone well. Since humans were creatures of convenience, the positives quickly overrode the bad memories. \n "], "Chapter 32": ["==============="], "Chapter 33": ["3.1 \n A fter taking a quick peek into the cafeteria, I opted instead to go to the convenience store, buy some bread, and return to class. About ten people had remained in the room. Some had pushed their desks together so they could all eat as a group, while other, more solitary students quietly ate their lunches alone. Everyone here had brought a lunch box from the cafeteria or convenience store. \n I was going to eat by myself, but then Horikita returned and sat down beside me. On Horikita\u2019s desk sat a delicious-looking sandwich. Her aura seemed to say, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me,\u201d so I returned to my seat without speaking. Just as I was about to sink my teeth into a sweet bun, music played through the speakers. \n \u201cAt five PM Japan Standard Time today, we will be holding a student club fair in Gymnasium No. 1. Students interested in joining a club, please gather in Gymnasium No. 1. I repeat, at\u2014\u201d \n A girl with a sweet voice continued the announcement. Club activities, huh? Come to think of it, I\u2019d never joined a club before. \n \u201cHey, Horikita\u2014\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m not interested in joining a club.\u201d \n \u201cI didn\u2019t even ask you anything yet.\u201d \n \u201cWell, what is it?\u201d \n \u201cAre you interested in joining a club?\u201d \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun, do you have dementia, or are you just an idiot? Didn\u2019t I just tell you that I\u2019m not interested?\u201d \n \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t join, though,\u201d I replied. \n \u201cNow you\u2019re just splitting hairs. Don\u2019t argue for the sake of arguing.\u201d \n \u201cOkay then.\u201d \n So, Horikita had no interest in making friends or joining clubs. She seemed annoyed whenever I tried to talk to her. I wondered if she\u2019d come to the school only to advance into higher education or get a job. If she wanted to advance to higher education, I wouldn\u2019t have found that too surprising, but I did consider it a bit of a waste. \n \u201cYou don\u2019t really have any friends, do you?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cSorry. But, hey, I can at least talk to you pretty well now.\u201d \n \u201cListen, don\u2019t count me as one of your friends.\u201d \n \u201cO-oh\u2026\u201d \n \u201cWell, since you apparently want to go find out about the clubs, do you intend to join one?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cOh, I\u2019m not sure, I guess. I\u2019m still thinking about it. Probably not, though.\u201d \n \u201cYou don\u2019t plan to join a club, but you want to go to the club fair? How odd. Do you plan to use this as a pretext for talking to people and making friends?\u201d \n How could she possibly be so sharp? No, I was probably just easy to read. \n \u201cSince I failed to make any friends on my first day, I thought that clubs would be my last chance.\u201d \n \u201cCan\u2019t you invite anyone other than me?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cIt\u2019s precisely because I don\u2019t have anyone else to invite that I\u2019m having such a hard time!\u201d \n \u201cTrue. However, I don\u2019t think you seriously mean what you\u2019re saying, Ayanokouji-kun. If you seriously want to make a friend, you should be more insistent.\u201d \n \u201cI can\u2019t, though. I\u2019ve devoted myself to walking a lonely road.\u201d \n Horikita took up her sandwich and quietly resumed eating. \u201cI have trouble comprehending your contradictory way of thinking.\u201d \n I wanted to make friends, but I couldn\u2019t. Horikita apparently found that incomprehensible. \n \u201cHave you ever joined any clubs, Horikita?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never been in one.\u201d \n \u201cThen, do you have any experience? You know, doing this or that?\u201d \n \u201cWhat exactly do you mean by \u2018that\u2019? I can\u2019t help but feel like that\u2019s a mean-spirited question.\u201d \n \u201cMean-spirited? Why? What did I say wrong?\u201d \n In one quick motion, Horikita karate-chopped me in the side. I coughed after being struck, unable to believe that a girl could hit so hard. \n \u201cWh-what was that for?!\u201d I cried. \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun. I\u2019ve warned you thoroughly, but it would appear that you haven\u2019t been listening. I think I may have to dole out rather merciless punishment to you later.\u201d \n \u201cAbsolutely not! Violence doesn\u2019t solve anything!\u201d \n \u201cOh, really? Violence has existed since the dawn of time. Violence has historically proven to be the human race\u2019s most effective means of achieving resolution. Violence is the most reliable method to make others listen, or safely deny their demands. Not to mention that, in many countries, the police who enforce the law use handguns and batons, wielding violence as a tool to make arrests.\u201d \n \u201cYou sure are rambling\u2026\u201d \n She gave a grand speech, insisting that hitting me had not been wrong. She also stated that her unreasonable behavior was reasonable. If I tried to argue, she would viciously tear me down. \n \u201cI think that I will employ violence to rehabilitate you, Ayanokouji-kun, and purge you of those impure thoughts. How does that sound?\u201d \n \u201cOkay then, what if I said the same thing to you , Horikita? What about that?\u201d \n At best, men who raised their hand against women were called \u201clowlifes\u201d and \u201ccowards.\u201d \n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t particularly mind, because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get the chance. Besides, if I never say anything wrong, then you\u2019ll never be able to reproach me.\u201d \n Her answer was totally unexpected. She really seemed to believe that she was always right. Even though she looked and spoke with the civility befitting an honors student, on the inside, she was a cruel beast. \n \u201cOkay, I get it, I get it. I\u2019ll be careful from now on.\u201d \n I gave up on Horikita and looked out the window. Ah, the weather today was so nice. \n \u201cClub activities, hmm. I see\u2026\u201d \n Horikita mumbled to herself as she pondered something. \n \u201cWell, if it\u2019s only for a little while after school, I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d she said. \n \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018a little while\u2019?\u201d \n \u201cYou asked me earlier, didn\u2019t you? You said you wanted to go to the club fair.\u201d \n \u201cOh, yeah. I never planned to stick around. I was just looking for a chance to go. Is that okay?\u201d \n \u201cIf it\u2019s just for a little while. All right, we\u2019ll go after class.\u201d \n After our conversation ended, we resumed eating our lunches. I had said that she was unpleasant earlier, but maybe things had turned around. Perhaps Horikita was actually a good person. \n \u201cWatching you flail about as you fail to make friends sounds somewhat interesting.\u201d \n Nope. She was unpleasant. \n "], "Chapter 34": ["==============="], "Chapter 35": ["3.2 \n \u201cT here are more people here than I expected.\u201d \n After class had ended for the day, Horikita and I went to the gymnasium. Nearly all of the students assembled there were freshmen. There were about a hundred people waiting around. We stood near the back of the room and waited for the fair to begin. While waiting, we glanced over the pamphlet that students received upon entering the gymnasium. The pamphlet contained detailed information about club activities. \n \u201cI wonder if this school has famous clubs. For example, something like karate.\u201d \n \u201cEvery club seems to operate on a high level. It looks like many athletes and club members here are famous throughout the nation.\u201d \n Even though this school didn\u2019t seem like a top-tier institution for activities like baseball and ballet, the clubs here certainly looked great. \n \u201cThese facilities are significantly more substantial than ordinary schools. Look, they even have O 2 chambers. The equipment here is so luxurious, it puts the professionals\u2019 stuff to shame. Oh, but it looks like they don\u2019t have a karate club after all.\u201d \n \u201cI see.\u201d \n \u201cWhat? Were you interested in karate or something?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cNo, not particularly.\u201d \n \u201cIt seems like it\u2019ll be hard for newcomers to get into the athletic clubs,\u201d I said. \u201cEven if a first year managed to break in, they still might just be a benchwarmer forever. I can\u2019t think that would be much fun.\u201d \n Everything around here seemed far too orderly. \n \u201cWouldn\u2019t that depend on one\u2019s efforts, though? Surely by training for one or two years, anyone could get in and play.\u201d \n Training, huh? I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to put in that amount of effort, no matter how desperate I was. \n \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that the concept of training even existed for someone who always avoided trouble, like you.\u201d \n \u201cWhat exactly does me not liking trouble have to do with that?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cWould you agree that someone who avoids trouble also avoids unnecessary manual labor? You said it first. You should keep to your word, I think.\u201d \n \u201cI didn\u2019t really think about it that deeply.\u201d \n \u201cIf you keep acting so non-committal, you\u2019re never going to be able to make any friends,\u201d she said. \n \u201cYou wound me, Horikita.\u201d \n \u201cThank you all for waiting, first-year students. We will now begin the club fair. A representative from each club will explain their function. My name is Tachibana, the student council secretary and the club fair\u2019s organizer. It\u2019s nice to meet you all.\u201d \n After Tachibana delivered the opening remarks, representatives from each club quickly lined up on a stage. It was quite a diverse crowd. The club representatives included everything from burly athletes in judo uniforms to students dressed in beautiful kimonos. \n \u201cHey, if you want to get a fresh start, why not try joining an athletic club? The judo club looks good, doesn\u2019t it? That upperclassman looks kind, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d encourage you.\u201d \n \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018kind\u2019?! He looks like a gorilla! He\u2019ll kill me for sure!\u201d I snapped. \n \u201cHe\u2019ll probably talk passionately about how easy judo is.\u201d \n \u201cCut it out!\u201d \n Sheesh. I\u2019d thought that we were having a decent conversation, but she\u2019d done nothing but stick it to me. \n \u201cEven if I wanted to join, the athletic clubs all look really intimidating. I get the impression they don\u2019t accept beginners.\u201d \n \u201cBeginners should be welcomed. The more members a club has, the more money they receive from the school. That\u2019s how they\u2019re able to get better training equipment.\u201d \n \u201cSounds like they\u2019re using the beginners for the money\u2026\u201d \n \u201cIt would be ideal to gather many new members as a budgetary increase, and then simply to bench them the rest of the time, like phantom members. If you were skilled at manipulation, that is.\u201d \n \u201cWhat an unpleasant world\u2026 You have a pretty strange way of thinking,\u201d I muttered. \n A girl dressed in archery gear stepped onto the stage. \u201cHello, my name is Hashigaki, the captain of the archery club. Many students may be under the impression that archery is an old-fashioned, simple activity, but it is actually a fun and rewarding sport. We welcome beginners with open arms. If you\u2019re interested, please consider joining.\u201d \n \u201cHey, look, they seem to be welcoming newcomers. Why don\u2019t you try joining? In order to increase their budget, that is,\u201d I said. \n \u201cI hate the idea of joining a club solely for that reason! Besides, athletic clubs are just gatherings of people with nothing better to do. Also, I probably wouldn\u2019t have fun if I didn\u2019t know anyone there. I\u2019d end up quitting in the blink of an eye.\u201d \n \u201cIsn\u2019t that simply your twisted personality talking?\u201d \n \u201cYeah, you\u2019re absolutely right. But athletic clubs are a no-go.\u201d \n I thought about joining a nice, calm, quiet club. \n \u201cTch!\u201d \n As the seniors introduced their respective clubs one after the other, I saw Horikita suddenly tense. She looked at the stage, her face pale. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d \n She didn\u2019t even seem to notice me anymore. I followed her line of sight to the stage, but I didn\u2019t find anything of note there. Just the representative of the school baseball team, dressed in uniform, giving his introduction. Had she fallen in love with him at first sight? No, I doubted it. Surprise? Disgust? Or maybe she was overjoyed? To be honest, Horikita\u2019s expression was complex and hard to read. \n \u201cHorikita, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d \n \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d \n It was like she couldn\u2019t hear my voice. She kept staring intently at the stage. I decided that I\u2019d stop talking to her and simply wait for an explanation. The baseball team\u2019s introduction wasn\u2019t any more compelling than the others. All things considered, the greeting was rather stock, no matter their schedule, appeal, or how welcoming they were to newcomers. \n It wasn\u2019t just the baseball club. Nearly every club\u2019s introduction was similarly ordinary. If anything surprised me about the fair, it was the substantial number of minor liberal arts-related clubs and organizations, such as the tea ceremony club or the calligraphy club. Also, I was surprised that you only needed a minimum of three people in order to form a new club. \n Every time one club finished and the next sprang up, the first-year students talked among themselves about what they thought. I noticed that the gymnasium\u2019s atmosphere was rather lively. Each club\u2019s representatives, including their supervising instructors, continued to explain their organizations to the unruly first-year students without a hint of displeasure. Perhaps they were just that desperate for more members, even if their ranks only increased by one. \n As the upperclassmen finished their introductions, they walked off the stage and headed toward an area where some plain tables had been set up. Probably a reception area designed to accept new members. Eventually, everyone walked off until only one person remained. Everyone focused their attention upon him, and I realized that Horikita had been staring at that specific person this whole time. \n He appeared to be about 170 centimeters in height, so he wasn\u2019t very tall. He was slender, with sleek black hair. He wore sharp glasses and had a piercing, calculating gaze. Standing in front of the microphone, he calmly looked around at the first-year students. What was his club, and what in the world was he going to say? My interest had been piqued. \n Unfortunately, my expectations were dashed immediately. He didn\u2019t say a single word. Maybe he was drawing a blank? Or perhaps he was so nervous that he couldn\u2019t speak? \n \u201cDo your best!\u201d \n \u201cDid you forget to bring your notecards?\u201d \n \u201cHa ha ha ha ha!\u201d \n The first-year students hurled comments at him. However, the upperclassman stood on the stage calmly, without trembling. The laughter and comments didn\u2019t seem to faze him. When the laughter had reached a crescendo, it suddenly died. He wore an apathetic expression. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s with this guy?\u201d remarked an astonished student. The gymnasium buzzed with people talking, yet the boy on the stage still did not move. He simply stood there, quiet and motionless, staring fixedly at the crowd. Horikita stared back at the student with an intense gaze, not breaking her line of sight even for a second. \n The relaxed atmosphere gradually changed, and things took an unexpected turn. It was as if some chemical reaction had taken place. An unbelievably tense, quiet mood gripped the entire gymnasium. Even though no orders had been given, the silence was so terrible that it seemed to have gagged everyone. Not a single student looked able to open his or her mouth. The silence continued for about thirty seconds or so\u2026 \n Then, the student started his speech, slowly scanning the crowd. \n \u201cI\u2019m the student council president. My name is Horikita Manabu,\u201d he said. \n Horikita? I glanced at the Horikita next to me. Perhaps they just happened to have the same surname. Or, maybe\u2026 \n \u201cThe student council is looking to recruit potential candidates among the first-year students to replace the graduating third years. Although no special qualifications are required for candidacy, we humbly ask that those considering application not be involved in other club activities. We generally do not accept students involved elsewhere.\u201d \n He spoke in a soft tone, but the tension around us was so thick it felt like you could cut it with a knife. He had managed to silence over a hundred new students in that spacious gymnasium. Of course, it wasn\u2019t his position as student council president that granted him this deference. That was simply Horikita Manabu\u2019s power. His presence dominated everyone around him. \n \u201cFurthermore, we in the student council do not wish to appoint anyone who possesses a naive outlook. Not only would such a person not be elected, he or she would sully the sanctity of this school. It is the student council\u2019s right and duty to enforce and amend the rules, but the school expects more than that. We gladly welcome those of you who understand this.\u201d \n He didn\u2019t pause even once during his eloquent speech. Immediately after finishing, he hopped off the stage and left the gymnasium. None of the first-year students could utter a single word as we watched him go. We didn\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened if we\u2019d tried to talk. Everyone in the room shared the same thought, apparently. \n \u201cThank you all for coming. The club fair has ended. We will now open the reception area to anyone interested in signing up. Also, registration will be open until the end of April, so if any student wishes to join at a later date, we ask that you please bring the application form directly to the club you wish to join.\u201d \n Thanks to the laid-back organizer, the tension in the air dissipated. Afterward, the third-year students who\u2019d introduced their respective clubs started taking applications. \n \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d \n Horikita remained still as a statue, giving no sign she would budge. \n \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked. \n Horikita didn\u2019t answer. It was like my words didn\u2019t even reach her ears. \n \u201cYo, Ayanokouji. You came, huh?\u201d \n As I was lost in thought, someone called out to me. Sudou. Our classmates Ike and Yamauchi were also with him. \n \u201cOh, hey, you three. Looks like you guys are getting along well, huh?\u201d I responded, feeling a bit envious of Sudou. \n \u201cSo, you joined a club, too?\u201d \n \u201cOh, no, I just came to check things out. Wait, \u2018too\u2019? Did you join a club, Sudou?\u201d \n \u201cYeah. I\u2019ve been playing basketball ever since elementary school. I thought I\u2019d join the team here.\u201d \n I had thought he was athletic, judging from his physique. Basketball was clearly his game. \n \u201cWhat about you two?\u201d \n \u201cWe just came because we felt it might be fun, you know? Besides, we thought we might have a fateful encounter afterward,\u201d Ike said. \n \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018fateful encounter\u2019?\u201d \n I wanted Ike to explain his rather odd-sounding goal. He crossed his arms and responded proudly, \u201cI want to get my first girlfriend in Class D. That\u2019s my goal. That\u2019s why I\u2019m keeping my eyes open for an encounter.\u201d \n Apparently, Ike considered having a girlfriend to be of the utmost priority. \n \u201cAlso, I have to say, that student council president was something else. He was so imposing. I got the feeling he ruled the place, you know?\u201d he said. \n \u201cI know, right? He made everyone shut up without saying a word. That kinda stuff is impossible,\u201d I replied. \n \u201cYeah. Oh, by the way, I made a group chat for the guys yesterday.\u201d Ike took out his phone. \u201cDo you want to join in, too? It\u2019s pretty handy.\u201d \n \u201cHuh? Me? Is that okay?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cOf course it\u2019s okay. We\u2019re all in Class D together, after all.\u201d \n "], "Chapter 36": ["==============="], "Chapter 37": [" filename=\"static\\uploads\\Classroom of the Elite - Volume 01 [Seven Seas][Kobo]\\images\\image12.jpg\"", "==============="], "Chapter 38": ["That was a rather unexpected proposal. I was happy to be invited to the group chat. Finally, I\u2019d found the perfect chance to make friends! However, when I took out my cell phone to exchange contact information, Horikita disappeared into the crowd. Worried about her, I stopped what I was doing. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ike asked. \n \u201cOh, nothing. You ready?\u201d \n I returned to my phone and exchanged contact information with Ike and the other guys. Horikita was free to do whatever she wanted, and I didn\u2019t have the right to stop her. For a moment, I\u2019d felt like following her, but in the end I decided not to. \n "], "Chapter 39": ["==============="], "Chapter 40": ["Chapter 4: Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank You for Waiting \n \u201cG ood morning, Yamauchi!\u201d \n \u201cGood morning, Ike!\u201d \n Arriving to class, Ike wore a broad grin as he called out to Yamauchi. It was rather unusual for them to get here so early. It\u2019d been one week since the entrance ceremony, and Ike and Yamauchi would always make it to class right before the bell rang. \n \u201cWhew, man! I was looking forward to today so much that I barely slept last night!\u201d \n \u201cAh ha ha! This school is just the best! I can\u2019t believe that it\u2019s almost time for swimming! And when I say swimming, I mean girls. And when I say girls, I mean girls in school swimsuits!\u201d \n It was true that the swimming classes were co-ed. In\u00a0other words, that meant that Horikita, Kushida, and all of the other girls would be\u2026showing off a lot of skin. The girls backed away from Ike and Yamauchi\u2019s rabid excitement. I, on the other hand, sat in my chair, isolated and alone. I couldn\u2019t do so forever. I had to proactively work at joining a group of friends. \n Fortunately, their conversation had ended, so I stood up. However, just then\u2026 \n \u201cHey, Professor! Come here for a sec!\u201d \n \u201cUh, you called?\u201d \n A chubby boy, apparently nicknamed \u201cThe Professor,\u201d approached them slowly. If I remembered correctly, his name was Sotomura or something like that. \n \u201cProfessor, can you record the girls wearing their swimsuits for us?\u201d Ike asked. \n \u201cLeave it to me. I\u2019ll pretend to be sick so that I can skip class and observe.\u201d \n \u201c Record? What are you planning?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cThe Professor is going to rank the girls\u2019 breast sizes for us. If we\u2019re lucky, he\u2019ll get some pictures with his phone.\u201d \n \u201cHey, hey.\u201d Sudou visibly drew back in response to Ike\u2019s plan. If the girls found out about it, the consequences would be severe. However, despite the content of the conversation, I was jealous of their easy banter. Having friends had to be nice. I wanted friends, too. \n \u201cPathetic,\u201d a familiar voice said. \n \u201cSo, you\u2019re here, too, huh, Horikita?\u201d \n \u201cI just arrived while you were looking at those boys over there. You didn\u2019t notice me. If you want to be their friend, why not try just talking to them?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cShut up and leave me alone already. If I could just do it, I wouldn\u2019t be agonizing over it.\u201d \n \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, you don\u2019t seem to be unsociable or lacking in communication skills, though.\u201d \n \u201cThere are a lot of reasons why I can\u2019t do it. So far, you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve been able to talk to, Horikita.\u201d \n Even though I\u2019d exchanged contact information with Ike and the others, I still hadn\u2019t been able to actually hold a conversation with them yet. \n \u201cWait just a minute. I already warned you not to, but you wouldn\u2019t be thinking of me as your friend, would you?\u201d said Horikita. She took a few steps away from me, as if in disgust. \n \u201cIt\u2019s fine. No matter how low I sink, I\u2019d never dream of being your friend,\u201d I replied. \n \u201cI see. I feel a little relieved.\u201d \n I wondered just how much she hated having friends. \n \u201cHey, Ayanokouji!\u201d Ike called my name. When I looked up, I saw him beaming at me. \n \u201cWh-what is it?\u201d I asked. \n I stood, stuttering as I did so. Horikita no longer showed any interest in me. A chance to enter into a new group of friends had suddenly fallen into my lap. \n \u201cTo tell you the truth, we\u2019re taking bets on the girls\u2019 chest sizes.\u201d \n \u201cWe\u2019ve come up with some probabilities.\u201d \n The Professor took out a tablet and opened a spreadsheet. The names of all the girls in our class were displayed. There were numbers listed as well. I honestly had no interest in gambling, but I couldn\u2019t let this opportunity go to waste. \n \u201cUmm. So, is it okay if I join you?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cYeah! Come on, do it. Do it!\u201d \n As of right now, Hasebe was the likeliest contender for the biggest breasts in the class. The odds sat at one to eight I hadn\u2019t heard most of the names before. I couldn\u2019t even remember my classmates\u2019 names. This was too awful. \n \u201cThis is way more elaborate than I would have thought. Aren\u2019t you observing them a little too closely?\u201d \n \u201cCome on. We\u2019re men, aren\u2019t we? Men have only two things constantly on their minds: tits and ass!\u201d \n Even if that were true, he really had no filter whatsoever. By the way, Horikita was ranked lowest. If you managed to win the bet, that was over thirty times your wager back. Well, in terms of breast size, it was obvious who would win and who would lose. Horikita had no chance. \n \u201cSo, what\u2019s your wager? It\u2019s 1000 points to join.\u201d \n \u201cI see\u2026\u201d \n I clearly lacked information. Scanning the list, I realized that not only did I not know the breast sizes of half the people here, I didn\u2019t even know the names and faces of most the girls. Actually, aside from Horikita and Kushida, I couldn\u2019t recall hearing about anyone else. Kushida seemed to have fairly large breasts, but not large enough to take first place. \n \u201cCome on, play with us. It\u2019s no fun if there\u2019re only a few people betting, you know?\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d \n \u201cMe too, me too!\u201d \n \u201cI have experience scouting girls and checking out their tits!\u201d \n While I considered the offer, boys crawled out of the woodwork around me, getting blatantly excited over the size of the girls\u2019 breasts. The girls in the classroom looked at us like we were dirt. \n \u201cI\u2019ll join, too. By the way, my money\u2019s on Sakura,\u201d Yamauchi chimed in. Sakura was a somewhat plain girl who wore glasses, but because I\u2019d barely talked to anyone, I honestly didn\u2019t know that much about her. While it looked like he was pondering something, Yamauchi tapped the Professor and Ike on the shoulders and whispered something to them. \n \u201cI\u2019m only telling you guys about this. The truth is, I actually confessed to Sakura.\u201d \n \u201cWhat?! S-seriously?!\u201d Ike was the most surprised and flustered by this. Had his goal to become the first guy in class to snag a girlfriend fallen through? \n \u201cYeah, seriously. But keep this on the down low. It\u2019s just between us, okay? I mean, I thought she was really plain at first, but then I saw her wearing regular clothes. She was huge , man.\u201d \n \u201cYou doofus. If she\u2019s not cute, you shouldn\u2019t ask her out, even if she\u2019s got huge tits. I wouldn\u2019t date anyone unless they were in the same league as Kushida or Hasebe. I\u2019m not interested in such a Plain Jane.\u201d \n He spoke harshly because no one else was around. I wondered how much I believed Yamauchi when he said that he\u2019d asked Sakura out. I had my doubts. In the end, I decided to place my bet on the girl with the highest odds. \n "], "Chapter 41": ["==============="], "Chapter 42": ["4.1 \n \u201cA ll right! The pool!\u201d \n After lunch had ended, it was finally time for swim class. Finally, the moment Ike and the others had so desperately been waiting for. Without even trying to hide his excitement, Ike leapt up and headed with the others toward the indoor pool. I followed behind them in what I thought was a stealthy manner. \n \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go together, Ayanokouji!\u201d \n \u201cHuh? O-okay.\u201d \n I\u2019d hesitated somewhat upon receiving Ike\u2019s invitation, but I hurried to join and followed them to the locker room. Sudou promptly removed his uniform and started to change, showing off his physique. He\u2019d built up his body through his years of basketball playing. Even in comparison with the other students, he was clearly in incredible \n shape. While the others wrapped themselves in bath towels, Sudou unabashedly wore only his underwear. He stood there, semi-nude, and took his swimsuit out of his bag. I couldn\u2019t keep myself from blurting something out. \n \u201cSudou, you\u2019re pretty bold. Aren\u2019t you nervous being around other people?\u201d \n \u201cIn sports, you can\u2019t get flustered every time you have to change. If you act all shifty, it\u2019ll have the opposite effect. You become the center of attention.\u201d \n He could say that again. In these sorts of places, sneaky guys got mocked. \n \u201cAll right, I\u2019m going on ahead.\u201d \n A moment later, Sudou left the locker room. I quickly finished changing as well. \n Upon seeing the fifty-meter pool, Ike cried out, \u201cWhoa, this school is something else! It\u2019s even better than the city pool, don\u2019t you think?\u201d The water was clear and beautiful, and because it was indoors, we didn\u2019t have to worry about the weather. The perfect environment. \n \u201cWhat about the girls? Aren\u2019t they here yet?\u201d \n Ike looked around, sniffing the air like a dog. \n \u201cThey take a while to change, so they\u2019re probably not ready,\u201d I said. \n \u201cHey, I wonder would what happen if I just suddenly jumped into the girls\u2019 locker room?\u201d Ike said. \n \u201cThey\u2019d gang up on you, beat the crap out of you, and then file charges, probably.\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t give me such a realistic, deadpan answer and ruin my fun!\u201d Ike began to tremble with fright as he played that scenario in his head. \n \u201cIf the girls sense you staring at them in their swimsuits, they\u2019ll probably hate you.\u201d \n \u201cCome on, like there\u2019s a guy out there who wouldn\u2019t stare! Agh. What am I gonna do if I get a boner?\u201d \n If that happened, they\u2019d probably hate Ike from that moment all the way until the day of our graduation. Wait a second, what was happening? Had I started talking naturally to Ike and the others? Even though until this morning I hadn\u2019t been able to join their group, I suddenly had my foot in the door, so to speak. This was the moment for a new friendship to be born. \n \u201cWow! It\u2019s so spacious! It\u2019s so much bigger than the pool at my junior high school.\u201d \n A few minutes after the boys had arrived, a girl\u2019s voice could be heard. \n \u201cA-are they here?!\u201d \n Ike looked ready to strike. If you were that obvious about it, the girls were bound to hate you. Even so, I was curious, too. I mostly wondered about Hasebe and Kushida, but a little about Horikita as well. I was particularly interested in Hasebe, the girl rumored to have the biggest tits in class. I didn\u2019t think there\u2019d be any harm in taking a little peek. However, it turned out that all of the boys\u2019 wishes were dashed by an unexpected turn of events. \n \u201cHasebe isn\u2019t here! Wh-what\u2019s going on, Professor?!\u201d Ike cried. \n The Professor, who had been watching the class, was now in a panic. Standing on the second-floor observation deck, he scanned the room. Ike and the others also looked around. At this height, the Professor\u2019s beady, bespectacled eyes should have spotted his prey instantly. However\u2026 \n He couldn\u2019t find the girls anywhere. He looked to his right and left, as if in disbelief. Could they still be changing? Or could\u2026 \n \u201cB-behind you, Professor!\u201d \n \u201cWhat?!\u201d \n Ike pointed and shouted. The situation had become clear. Hasebe stood behind the Professor on the observation deck. One by one, the rest of the girls appeared, until they\u2019d all emerged onto the second floor. Sakura was among them. \n \u201cWh-what\u2019s going on? How did this happen?\u201d \n Ike slumped to the ground and buried his face in his hands, shaken by this unbelievable turn of events. Hasebe seemed to be self-conscious about being considered a beautiful girl. Furthermore, she seemed to dislike getting curious looks from the boys. She was not amused at their attempts to ogle. \n \u201cAw, but I thought I\u2019d get to see big tits! Big tits! I thought this was my chance!\u201d \n Ike appeared to be contemplating suicide. His wails of agony reached Hasebe. \n \u201cGross,\u201d the girls muttered among themselves. Ike was being far too obvious, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that the girls hated him\u2026 \n \u201cIke, don\u2019t be sad! Come on, there are still tons of girls out there for us!\u201d Yamauchi said. \n \u201cY-yeah, that\u2019s right. You got a point. I can\u2019t get down in the dumps now!\u201d Ike cried. \n \u201cBro!\u201d Yamauchi and Ike reaffirmed their manly bond of friendship, clasping their hands together. \n \u201cWhat are you two doing? That looks like fun.\u201d \n \u201cK-K-Kushida-chan?!\u201d \n Kushida showed up between the two of them. She was clad in her school-issued swimwear, which nicely showed off her voluptuous figure. In an instant, nearly all of the boys\u2019 eyes were glued to Kushida\u2019s body. She must have been a D or E cup. I didn\u2019t know for sure, but I estimated. She was a lot bigger than I\u2019d thought. Her butt and thighs were also more voluptuous than I had pictured, which was strangely captivating. However, all of us boys quickly averted our gaze. \n Ah, the weather was so nice today\u2026 World peace truly was wonderful. \n Once the inevitable physiological reaction kicked in, it was quite a terrible shock. \n \u201cWhy the pained expression?\u201d Horikita examined my face closely, with a suspicious look. \n \u201cI\u2019m currently in the midst of an internal battle,\u201d I replied. \n Horikita was in a school swimsuit. How to put it? Yeah. She looked good. Not bad at all. But if I stared, it was likely that something bad would result. I thought it best to grin and bear it until I calmed down. \n "], "Chapter 43": ["==============="], "Chapter 44": [" filename=\"static\\uploads\\Classroom of the Elite - Volume 01 [Seven Seas][Kobo]\\images\\image13.jpg\"", "==============="], "Chapter 45": ["\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d \n For some reason, Horikita was checking me out all over. \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun, do you exercise?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cHuh? No, not really. I\u2019m not particularly proud of this, but in middle school I was the kid who never had any after-school plans.\u201d \n \u201cWell, you say that, but\u2026judging from the development of your forearms and your back muscles, you seem above average.\u201d \n \u201cI guess my parents blessed me with good genes?\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the only reason.\u201d \n \u201cJeez, what\u2019s with you? Do you have a muscle fetish or something? Is that it?\u201d \n \u201cI suppose if you deny it that much, I have to believe you\u2026\u201d \n She appeared somewhat dissatisfied. I guessed that Horikita had a rather discerning eye and enjoyed using it. \n \u201cAre you a good swimmer, Horikita-san?\u201d \n Although Horikita gave a slightly puzzled look in response to Kushida\u2019s question, she quietly answered. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m particularly good or bad at it.\u201d \n \u201cI was really bad at swimming when I was in junior high. But I gave it my all and practiced really hard, and now I think I\u2019ve gotten better,\u201d Kushida said. \n \u201cI see.\u201d Horikita gave a disinterested response and backed away slightly, clearly signaling that she didn\u2019t want to continue the conversation further. \n \u201cAll right, everyone, line up!\u201d \n A macho-looking middle-aged man, the kind of guy who apparently devoted himself to sports, gathered everyone together and started the class. He looked like a PE teacher, but also seemed like the kind of guy who was attractive to men and women alike. \n \u201cThere are sixteen of you, huh? I thought there would\u2019ve been more, but this is all right.\u201d \n Clearly, some of the students in that count had ditched class, but it didn\u2019t appear to frustrate him. \n \u201cAfter you warm up, I want to see what you can really do. Swim for me,\u201d the coach said. \n \u201cExcuse me, sir. I can\u2019t really swim, though\u2026\u201d \n A lone boy sheepishly raised his hand and spoke up. \n \u201cSince you have me as your teacher, you\u2019ll be swimming by summertime. Don\u2019t worry about a thing.\u201d \n \u201cWell, we don\u2019t really need to force ourselves to swim, do we? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to the beach or anything.\u201d \n \u201cNo way. I don\u2019t mind at all if you\u2019re bad at swimming now, but I\u2019ll make sure you guys are winners in the end. Besides, being able to swim will definitely come in handy later in life. Definitely.\u201d \n Swimming would definitely come in handy? Well, I suppose knowing how to swim would be convenient. However, hearing a teacher say something like that made me feel uncomfortable. Though, he probably just wanted to keep the students from sinking like rocks. \n Everyone started their warm-up exercises. Ike kept peeking at the girls. The teacher asked us to swim for about fifty meters. Students who could not swim were allowed to touch the bottom of the pool with their feet. I hadn\u2019t been in a pool since last summer. The water must have been temperature-controlled, because I didn\u2019t feel chilled when I entered and adjusted right away. After getting in, I started to swim lightly. \n After fifty meters, I waited for everyone else to finish. \n \u201cHe he he, that was an easy win for me. Did you all see my super swimming skills?\u201d Ike crowed. \n He\u2019d swum expertly, and now got out of the pool with a smug, self-satisfied grin. No, Ike, your performance wasn\u2019t really that different from anyone else\u2019s. \n \u201cWell, it looks like everyone can swim, for the most part.\u201d \n \u201cOf course, sir. Back in junior high, people called me \u2018the flying fish,\u2019 you know.\u201d \n \u201cI see. In that case, I\u2019ll have you start competing against each other. We\u2019ll separate groups by gender. Fifty-meter freestyle.\u201d \n \u201cC-compete?! Are you serious?\u201d Ike cried. \n \u201cI\u2019ll give out a special bonus to the first-place winner: 5000 points. The student who comes in last place, however, will have to take supplementary lessons. Get ready.\u201d \n The skilled swimmers cheered with joy, while the less confident students groaned. \n \u201cBecause we don\u2019t have very many girls, I\u2019ll split you into two groups of five people, and the student with the fastest overall time will be the winner. As for the boys, I\u2019ll look at the top five finishing times and then move on to a final round.\u201d \n I\u2019d never imagined that the school would award points as a prize. Perhaps this was a way to light a fire under the students. Rather well thought out, I had to say. Excluding the observers and the one student who couldn\u2019t swim, there were sixteen boys and ten girls competing. The girls started first, while the boys sat on the sidelines, filled with excitement as they cheered\u2026 no, as they assessed the girls. \n \u201cKushida-chan, Kushida-chan, Kushida-chan, Kushida-chan, Kushida-chan. Haaaaaaa\u2026\u201d \n It looked like Kushida had completely entranced Ike. \n \u201cYou\u2019re scaring everyone, Ike, settle down,\u201d I mumbled. \n \u201cB-but, Kushida-chan is so goddamn cute, isn\u2019t she? And her breasts are pretty big, too!\u201d \n Kushida immediately dominated the boys\u2019 attention. Would any of the other girls catch up to her? If you focused on her face alone, Horikita could definitely have been in the top tier, but because she loathed social interaction so much, her popularity had dipped. Despite that, many of the boys thought she looked great, so she got plenty of cheers at the starting line. \n \u201cEveryone, burn these images into your mind! Remember the fap material you see here today!\u201d Ike cried. \n \u201cYeah!\u201d everyone shouted. \n Somehow, swimming had strengthened the boys\u2019 bond. The only exception was Hirata, who seemed to avoid looking at the girls. The whistle blew, and five of the girls dove into the water. Horikita was in the second lane. She took the lead at the beginning of the race and kept her distance from the others, maintaining her position at the front of the pack. She swam confidently, effortlessly covering the fifty meters. \n \u201cWow! Awesome, Horikita!\u201d \n Her time was approximately twenty-eight seconds. She was pretty fast. Horikita slowly got out of the pool and went to the side, not even appearing out of breath. To the boys, results were of secondary importance. Their eyes were glued to the girls\u2019 jiggling butts. I stared at Horikita, too. Was it because we were getting along? Well, she was a girl. There was something there, I thought. Yeah. \n After that came the second race. Kushida, the most popular girl, was in the fourth lane. The boys cheered for her, smiling and waving. \n \u201cWhoo!\u201d \n Wow, those guys were really riled up. Some even tried to sneakily cover their crotches. During our introductions, Kushida had announced that she wanted to make friends with everyone in class. It looked like her wish had already pretty much come true. It wasn\u2019t just the boys, either; girls were around her constantly, too, chatting away happily. Kushida had an air that attracted other people. \n The second race began. The contest ended up being rather one-sided. A girl named Onodera, who had been on swim teams before, won by a mile. She finished with a time of about twenty-six seconds, netting her the win. Kushida finished at about thirty-one seconds, which was a fairly good time, but only resulted in her getting fourth place. I went over to the side of the pool to talk with Horikita. \n \u201cYou were so close. Second place, I mean. I guess that those guys on the swim team were really tough, huh?\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t mind whether I win or lose. Enough about me. Are you feeling confident in yourself?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cOh, definitely. I just can\u2019t come in last.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s not really something to take pride in. I thought boys were supposed to be fixated on winning and losing.\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t like competing against people. I just like avoiding trouble, after all,\u201d I said. \n I\u2019d given up on trying to get first place from the very beginning. All I wanted was to avoid taking those supplementary lessons. I was assigned my spot and placed in the second lane, while Sudou was in the first, right next to me. It was impossible to even hope to match Sudou\u2019s pace, so I didn\u2019t plan to try. I aimed to come in somewhere in the middle, just not last. With that in mind, the race started, and we dove in. \n Sudou finished the fifty-meter race with incredible speed. The boys and girls cheered in admiration. \n \u201cWow, you\u2019re amazing, Sudou. You finished the race in twenty-five seconds!\u201d they cried. \n I, on the other hand, finished in thirty-six seconds. It looked like I got tenth place. All right, no supplementary lessons for me. \n \u201cSudou, won\u2019t you consider joining the swim team? If you practice, you could probably win at competitions!\u201d \n \u201cBasketball is my only sport. Swimming\u2019s just for fun.\u201d Sudou, who hadn\u2019t even broken a sweat, calmly got out of the pool. \n \u201cOh, wow, he has absolutely outstanding motor skills.\u201d \n Ike, feeling envious, elbowed Sudou. \n \u201cKya!\u201d \n A girl let out a joyful scream as Hirata took his starting position. Whereas Sudou\u2019s body had attracted the boys\u2019 admiration, Hirata\u2019s body attracted the girls. He was slender, but also well built. You could say he was a macho pretty boy. After hearing the girls\u2019 delighted squeals for Hirata, Ike spat in response. Sudou didn\u2019t seem very amused either, and shot Hirata a glare. \n \u201cI\u2019m going to blow you out of the water. I\u2019ll use all of my power,\u201d he growled. \n Didn\u2019t he say that he swam just for fun ? \n After the teacher blew the whistle, Hirata dove into the pool with beautiful form. Every time Hirata\u2019s arms cut through the water, the girls cheered by the side of the pool. His form was effortlessly cool. \n \u201cHe\u2019s surprisingly fast,\u201d Sudou commented. It was certainly true that Hirata swam fast. There was no doubt that he\u2019d shot ahead of the four other boys who were competing with him. This, of course, prompted more shrieks from the girls. Hirata didn\u2019t fail to live up to our expectations: He came in first place. Deafening cheers reverberated throughout the room. \n \u201cSensei, what was his time?\u201d asked Ike, impatiently. \n \u201cHirata\u2019s time was\u202626.13 seconds.\u201d \n \u201cAll right. You can do it, Sudou. You can definitely win against him! Bring down the hammer of justice!\u201d \n \u201cLeave it to me. I\u2019ll demolish him and his popularity\u2026\u201d \n Ike\u2019s encouragement had Sudou all fired up, but even if Hirata lost, it wasn\u2019t likely that his popularity would drop. \n \u201cHirata-kun, you were so cool! You\u2019re not just good at soccer, you\u2019re really good at swimming!\u201d one girl cried. \n \u201cYou think so? Thank you!\u201d he said. \n \u201cHey, why are you ogling Hirata-kun like that?\u201d another girl said. \n \u201cHuh? I\u2019m \u2018ogling\u2019?!\u201d \n There was an indignant squeal. \n Hirata\u2019s immense popularity was unbelievably frustrating. \n \u201cCome on, girls, knock it off. Please don\u2019t fight over me. I belong to everyone. I want to be everyone\u2019s friend. Besides, what if someone who\u2019s better at swimming comes along?\u201d \n Kouenji mistakenly seemed to assume that the cheers were for him. He put on a refreshing smile and then planted his feet by the starting line. \n \u201cHey. Uh, why is Kouenji wearing a speedo?\u201d \n \u201cWh-what?\u201d \n Although the school allowed such tight swimwear, Kouenji was the only one in our class wearing it. The briefs drew attention to his crotch, and the girls all looked away. However, in the third race, all eyes were on Kouenji. The stance he took at the starting line was just like an athlete\u2019s. His posture wasn\u2019t the only impressive thing, either. He looked to be in even better physical shape than Sudou. Sudou and all of the other boys in class held their breath as they attentively focused on Kouenji. \n \u201cI\u2019m not particularly interested in winning or losing\u2026but I don\u2019t like losing,\u201d said Sudou, to no one in particular. \n As the whistle blew, Kouenji dove into the pool with textbook form. \n \u201cWhoa! Wow!\u201d \n Sudou gave a surprised shout in response to Kouenji\u2019s unexpectedly aggressive swimming. Hirata also stared in apparent amazement. Kouenji splashed fiercely as he swam, but it didn\u2019t slow his incredible speed. He was unquestionably faster than Sudou. After checking the time, the teacher reflexively looked at his stopwatch twice. \n \u201c23.22 seconds.\u201d \n \u201cMy abdominal muscles, back muscles, and psoas major muscle seem to be in good shape, as usual. Not a bad performance,\u201d Kouenji said. \n After getting out of the pool, he smirked and swept his hair up. He wasn\u2019t short of breath at all. It was as if he hadn\u2019t even swum in the first place. \n \u201cI\u2019m fired up!\u201d Sudou didn\u2019t want to lose, so his competitive spirit flared. To be honest, Sudou was the only one who had any chance of winning against Kouenji. The final round was more like a one-on-one match between the two of them. \n \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to this. Both Kouejin-kun and Sudou-kun are so fast,\u201d Kushida said. \n \u201cA-ah, yeah.\u201d \n Standing beside a swimsuit-clad beauty, I\u2019d entered a state of emergency, my heart pounding in my chest. \n \u201cHmm? What\u2019s the matter? Your face looks red for some reason. Are you not feeling well, by chance?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cOh, no, no, that\u2019s not it at all\u2026\u201d \n \u201cWell, even so, something seems unusual. Why do we have swimming classes in April, anyway?\u201d \n \u201cBecause we have such an incredible indoor pool. Oh, yeah, that reminds me\u2026 You were pretty fast, Kushida. I can\u2019t believe that you weren\u2019t very good at swimming in junior high.\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re much faster than average, too, Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d \n \u201cNah, I\u2019m pretty average. I don\u2019t really like to exercise.\u201d \n \u201cIs that so? But you look like a really manly guy, Ayanokouji-kun. Even though you\u2019re so slim, I could say that you\u2019re even better built than Sudou, and he plays basketball.\u201d \n Kushida examined my body in shock and awe, as if she were thinking \u201c Really? Really? \u201d I was ten times more nervous now than when Horikita had stared at me. \n \u201cI was just born naturally muscular. There\u2019s no special reason behind it. To tell you the truth, I\u2019m not in any clubs.\u201d \n The conversation revolved around good health. I felt somewhat nervous, but strangely satisfied as well. We continued in this way for a while; I\u2019d wanted to talk with Kushida alone. \n \u201cWow, Kouenji is amazing. I thought that Sudou would have won in a landslide\u2026 What the heck is going on, Ayanokouji?\u201d Ike asked. \n It looked like Kouenji had beaten Sudou by about a five-meter lead in the final round. After he\u2019d finished observing the race, Ike zeroed in on me, his face like a demon\u2019s. \n \u201cUh, nothing really. I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d I replied. \n \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d \n He wrapped his arms around my shoulders and whispered in my ear. \n \u201cI\u2019m aiming for Kushida-chan. Don\u2019t get in the way!\u201d \n I didn\u2019t exactly plan to get in the way, but his goal was slightly unrealistic. I didn\u2019t think Kushida was the type who\u2019d stoop to being with someone like Ike. Of course, I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d get with me, either. \n "], "Chapter 46": ["==============="], "Chapter 47": ["Chapter 5: Friends \n \u201cK ikyou-chan, do you want to stop by a caf\u00e9 on our way back today?\u201d \n \u201cSure, let\u2019s go! Oh, but wait just a minute, okay? I want to invite one more person.\u201d \n Kushida headed toward Horikita, who was putting her textbook into her bag. \u201cHorikita-san, would you like to come with us to a caf\u00e9 today?\u201d She asked. \n \u201cNot interested.\u201d Horikita threw Kushida\u2019s invitation back in her face, with no room for ambiguity. Couldn\u2019t you just lie and say you were planning to go shopping, or that you were waiting for a friend? Despite the harsh rejection, Kushida kept smiling. \n This wasn\u2019t a particularly unusual scene. Ever since the entrance ceremony, Kushida had regularly tried to invite Horikita to do fun things with her. I thought it would be nice for Horikita to accept an invitation at least once in a while, but perhaps that was just a bystander\u2019s selfish interpretation. No one had ever met with anything but rejection when they\u2019d tried to invite Horikita. \n \u201cI see. Well then, I\u2019ll try inviting you again another time.\u201d \n \u201cWait, Kushida-san.\u201d Surprisingly, Horikita called out to Kushida. Had she finally given in? \u201cDon\u2019t invite me again. It\u2019s a bother,\u201d said Horikita coldly. \n However, Kushida didn\u2019t appear saddened. Instead, she smiled as she answered, \u201cI\u2019ll invite you again.\u201d \n Kushida then ran back to join her friends, and they left the hall. \n \u201cKikyou-chan, just stop inviting Horikita-san. I hate her\u2014\u201d \n Just before the door closed, I faintly heard one of the other girl\u2019s words. Horikita, who was right next to me, must have heard as well, but she gave no indication that she cared. \n \u201cYou won\u2019t try to invite me places, will you?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cNope. I understand your personality well enough. It\u2019s pointless to even try.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m relieved to hear that.\u201d \n After Horikita finished getting ready, she walked out of the classroom by herself. I absentmindedly stuck around for a little while, but soon grew bored and got up. Time to go home , I thought. \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun, do you have a moment?\u201d \n Hirata, who was still hanging around, called out to me when I passed by. Unbothered, I responded to him softly. It was unusual for Hirata to notice me. \n \u201cIt\u2019s about Horikita-san, actually. I was wondering if something was wrong. Some of the girls were talking about it earlier. Horikita always seems to be alone.\u201d \n Maybe it wasn\u2019t Kushida especially. Perhaps Horikita was just the kind of person who strongly disliked company. \n \u201cCould you possibly tell her to try to get along with people a little?\u201d \n \u201cWell, that\u2019s up to the individual, isn\u2019t it? Besides, Horikita isn\u2019t really making trouble for anyone else,\u201d I replied. \n \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. However, many people have voiced their concerns about it. I absolutely do not want any bullying in our class.\u201d \n Bullying? Such talk seemed premature, but perhaps there were signs of it. Was he warning me, then? Hirata looked at me with the purest of intentions. \n \u201cWell, I think it\u2019d be better for you to tell her directly rather than talk to me, Hirata,\u201d I said. \n \u201cYou have a point. Sorry for bringing it up.\u201d \n Horikita was always alone, day after day. If this continued, within a month she\u2019d be like a tumor in our class. However, this was Horikita\u2019s personal problem and something I probably shouldn\u2019t involve myself with. \n "], "Chapter 48": ["==============="], "Chapter 49": ["5.1 \n A fter leaving class, I went straight toward the dormitory. Kushida, who was supposed to have left with a friend earlier, appeared to be waiting for someone while leaning up against the wall. Noticing me, she smiled like always. \n \u201cI\u2019m so glad! I was waiting for you, Ayanokouji-kun. There\u2019s something I wanted to talk to you about. Do you have a minute?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cYeah, sure\u2026\u201d \n She couldn\u2019t be confessing her feelings for me, could she? Nah, there was about a 1 percent chance of something like that. \n \u201cI\u2019ll just ask you outright. Ayanokouji-kun, have you seen Horikita-san smile even once?\u201d \n \u201cHuh? No, not that I can remember.\u201d \n Apparently, Kushida had come to talk about Horikita again. Thinking back, I didn\u2019t recall ever seeing Horikita smile once. Kushida took my hand in hers, closing the distance between us. Did she smell of flowers? I breathed in an extremely pleasant scent. \n \u201cYou know, I\u2026I want to become friends with Horikita-san,\u201d she said. \n \u201cI think she guesses your feelings. At first, a lot of people tried reaching out to her, but now you\u2019re the only one.\u201d \n \u201cYou seem to know Horikita-san pretty well, Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m watching her or anything, it\u2019s just that you tend to learn a lot about the person who sits next to you.\u201d \n Girls were girls, after all, and they\u2019d been really eager to form groups since the first day of school. They were also more aware of cliques and social circles than guys, and in this class of about twenty people, four held the most influence. You could claim they put up a fa\u00e7ade, that they weren\u2019t genuinely being themselves. \n However, Kushida was the exception. She definitely held favor within each group, but more than that, she was tremendously popular with everyone. She was persistently warm and gentle toward Horikita, as part of her continued efforts to become her friend. That wasn\u2019t something an ordinary student could do. That was probably why everyone adored her. \n Plus, she was really cute. \n Cuteness makes everything better. \n \u201cDidn\u2019t Horikita already warn you not to try again? I don\u2019t know what you can say to her next time,\u201d I said. \n I knew that Horikita wasn\u2019t the type to mince words. If approached, she would probably respond harshly. To be honest, I didn\u2019t want to see Kushida hurt. \n \u201cWon\u2019t you\u2026help me?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cUh\u2026\u201d \n I didn\u2019t answer right away. Normally, I would immediately agree to such a cute girl\u2019s demands. However, since I was the type to avoid trouble, I couldn\u2019t answer her. I didn\u2019t want to see Horikita hurt Kushida by saying something merciless. I thought I\u2019d turn her down to avoid any later heartbreak. \n \u201cI understand how you feel, Kushida, but\u2026\u201d \n \u201cSo that means\u2026you can\u2019t?\u201d \n Cute + Pleading + Upturned Eyes = Lethal. \n \u201cWell, I guess I don\u2019t have a choice. Just this once, okay?\u201d \n \u201cReally?! Oh, thank you, Ayanokouji-kun!\u201d she cried. Kushida\u2019s face lit up. \n She was cute. Even though I\u2019d agreed to help her, I was still the kind of person who preferred to remain in the background. I shouldn\u2019t do anything reckless. \n \u201cSo, what exactly are we going to do? Even if you say you want to be friends with her, it\u2019s not that simple.\u201d \n Personally, I wasn\u2019t equipped to know how to make friends. \n \u201cYou\u2019re probably right\u2026 Well, first I think we should try to make Horikita-san smile,\u201d Kushida said. \n \u201cMake her smile, huh?\u201d \n Smiling means letting your guard down in front of another person, even if just a little. Such a relationship could most likely be referred to as friendship. Kushida seemed to understand people well, especially when it came to making them smile. \n \u201cDo you have an idea how?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cWell, I thought you could help me think of something, Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d She giggled sheepishly and lightly smacked her own head. If she were an ugly girl, I would have been totally turned off, but Kushida made it charming. \n \u201cSmile, huh?\u201d So, because Kushida had asked, I was going to help her make Horikita smile. Was such a thing possible? I wondered. I doubted it. \n \u201cWell, anyway, after class, I\u2019m going to try inviting Horikita out again. If we wind up back at the dorms, though, I\u2019ll have no idea what to do. Is there any place that she wants to go to?\u201d \n \u201cAh. Well then, how about Palate? I\u2019ve gone to Palate often, and Horikita might have overheard us talking about it before.\u201d \n Palate was one of the most popular caf\u00e9s on campus. I had heard about Kushida and the other girls going there often after class. And if I\u2019d heard about it, then Horikita must have also been aware. \n \u201cHow about if you two went to Palate and ordered, and then \u2018bumped\u2019 into me by chance? Would that work?\u201d \n \u201cProbably not. I think that might be expecting a little too much. What if your friends helped out, Kushida?\u201d \n The instant Horikita noticed Kushida\u2019s presence, she would probably get up and leave. I thought it\u2019d be better to create a situation that would make leaving difficult. I told Kushida my idea. \n \u201cOoh! That certainly sounds like it would work! You\u2019re so smart, Ayanokouji-kun!\u201d she cried. Kushida nodded in agreement while she hung on my every word, eyes sparkling. \n \u201cOh, no, I don\u2019t think my plan has anything to do with being smart. Anyway, that\u2019s what I was going for.\u201d \n \u201cI understand. I\u2019m excited for the result!\u201d \n No, don\u2019t expect too much. That\u2019ll be trouble. \n \u201cIf you try inviting her, Kushida, she\u2019ll probably refuse you outright. So, how about I invite Horikita?\u201d \n \u201cOkay. I think that Horikita-san trusts you, Ayanokouji-kun,\u201d she said. \n \u201cWhy do you think that? What proof do you have?\u201d \n \u201cWell, I guess it just looks that way to me. She seems to trust you more than anyone else in the class, at the very least.\u201d \n That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m best suited for this task, though. \n \u201cThat\u2019s only because I was able to talk to her, but that was a coincidence.\u201d \n I\u2019d just happened to be seated next to her on the bus. If that hadn\u2019t happened, then I probably wouldn\u2019t have talked to her. \n \u201cBut don\u2019t you meet almost every person for the first time by chance? And then they can become your friend, or your best friend\u2026or even your boyfriend or girlfriend, or your family.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d \n I supposed that was one way to look at it. Coincidence had allowed me to talk with Kushida like this. Therefore, it was possible that Kushida and I might eventually become lovers. \n "], "Chapter 50": ["==============="], "Chapter 51": ["5.2 \n C lasses had ended. The other students left for their various after-school activities, talking to one another about where they would go. Meanwhile, Kushida and I exchanged looks, signaling each other to go ahead with the plan. \n \u201cHey, Horikita. Do you have some free time after class today?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cI don\u2019t have any time to waste. I have to go back to the dormitory and prepare for tomorrow.\u201d \n Prepare for tomorrow? I was pretty sure all she did was study. \n \u201cI wanted you to go somewhere with me for a little bit.\u201d \n \u201cWhat are you after?\u201d \n \u201cDo you think that by inviting you out, I\u2019m after something?\u201d \n \u201cWell, when you invite me so suddenly, I naturally have my doubts. However, if there is a specific matter that you wish to discuss, I wouldn\u2019t mind listening.\u201d \n I didn\u2019t have anything to talk about, of course. \n \u201cWell, you know that caf\u00e9 on campus? The one with a ton of girls? I don\u2019t have the guts to go there all by myself. I kind of get the feeling that guys are banned from entering there or something. Don\u2019t you?\u201d \n \u201cI certainly can\u2019t argue that most of their customers seem to be women, but aren\u2019t men also allowed to patronize the caf\u00e9?\u201d \n \u201cWell, yeah, but no guy goes there alone. Only if they\u2019re with friends who are girls, or if they\u2019re someone\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d \n Horikita tried to recall what Palate was like, seemingly lost in thought for a moment. \n \u201cYou may very well be right. It\u2019s unusual for you to express such a well-reasoned opinion, Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d \n \u201cBut I\u2019m still interested in it. So I wanted to invite you to come along with me.\u201d \n \u201cI suppose that\u2019s natural, since you supposedly have\u2026no one else to invite, correct?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cThat makes it sound like I\u2019m imposing on you, but yeah. Basically.\u201d \n \u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d \n \u201cWell, that would be that. I\u2019d have no choice but to accept. I can\u2019t force you to give up your private time, after all.\u201d \n \u201cI understand. Your issue with the caf\u00e9 is certainly accurate. I can\u2019t stay there for too long, though. Is that all right?\u201d \n \u201cSure. We\u2019ll be quick.\u201d \n In my mind, I added the word \u201cprobably\u201d to that last thought. If she knew that Kushida was involved in this, Horikita would probably have some strong words for me. I\u2019d begun to think that, since I was able to talk to Kushida, I might be able to make friends with Horikita myself. Besides, whether it was a caf\u00e9 or a lecture hall, Horikita always came with me, even as she complained about it. For someone like me, who had difficulty making friends, this was probably a miracle. \n The two of us left the classroom and made our way to Palate on the first floor. Girls began to congregate there, one after another, enjoying their time after class. \n \u201cThere are so many people here,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cIs this your first time doing anything social, Horikita? Oh, yeah, I suppose it would be. You\u2019re always alone.\u201d \n \u201cWas that supposed to be sarcastic? How childish.\u201d \n I\u2019d meant to engage in some playful ribbing, but apparently that was impossible for Horikita. After we placed our order, we both got our drinks. I ordered the single serving of pancakes. \n \u201cDo you like sweets?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cI just wanted to have pancakes.\u201d \n I didn\u2019t particularly like or dislike cakes and stuff, but I needed a believable reason. \n \u201cThere aren\u2019t any open seats, though.\u201d \n \u201cI guess we\u2019ll just have to wait a bit. Oh, never mind. There are some open seats over there.\u201d \n I noticed that two girls quickly got up from their table, and I hurriedly went to secure our spot. Horikita passed around the table. I set my bag down on the floor, took my seat, and looked about casually. \n \u201cHey, I just thought of something. If the people around here see us like this, they\u2019ll probably think we\u2019re a couple\u2026\u201d \n Horikita remained expressionless, or rather, cold. Being in such crowded surroundings was making me anxious. As I considered what was about to happen, my stomach started to hurt. \n I thought I heard the two girls sitting next to me say, \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d before grabbing their drinks and leaving. Another patron sat down immediately. It was Kushida. \n \u201cAh, Horikita-san. What a coincidence! And Ayanokouji-kun too!\u201d she said. \n \u201cHey.\u201d \n Kushida had given us a simple greeting, maintaining the ruse that this was a coincidence. Horikita regarded Kushida with narrowed eyes, then slowly turned her gaze toward me. Of course, this was something that Kushida and I had planned out in advance. Kushida\u2019s friends had already secured four seats for us ahead of time. When I arrived at Palate, I sent them a signal so that they could make two seats available. After some time, the other girls next to me left, giving Kushida a chance to come and sit down. As a result, our meeting looked like it\u2019d come about via coincidence. \n \u201cDid you come here together, Ayanokouji-kun? Horikita-san?\u201d Kushida asked. \n \u201cYeah, we just happened to. Did you come by yourself?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cYeah. Today, I\u2014\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cH-hey, we just got here, though.\u201d \n \u201cYou don\u2019t need me now that Kushida-san is here, though. Right?\u201d \n \u201cHold on, that\u2019s not a problem. Kushida and I are just classmates.\u201d \n \u201cYou and I are just classmates, too. Besides\u2026\u201d She gave Kushida and me an icy look. \u201cI don\u2019t like this. What are you plotting?\u201d She\u2019d seen through our plan and was trying to get me to admit it. \n \u201cN-no, it was just a coincidence,\u201d Kushida said. \n Kushida shouldn\u2019t have said such a thing. Asking, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d and acting ignorant of Horikita\u2019s prodding would\u2019ve been the better response. \n \u201cWhen we sat down earlier, I saw the two girls seated here were from Class D, along with the two girls seated next to us as well. Was that just a coincidence, too?\u201d \n \u201cOh, wow, really? I didn\u2019t notice at all,\u201d Kushida said. \n \u201cAlso, we came straight here after classes ended. No matter how much those girls rushed, they could only have been here for about one to two minutes at the most. It was far too early for them to get up and leave. Am I wrong?\u201d \n Horikita was even more incredibly observant than I\u2019d thought. Not only did she remember our classmates\u2019 faces, but she\u2019d quickly grasped the situation. \n \u201cUm, well\u2026\u201d A bewildered Kushida signaled for me to save her somehow. Horikita noticed. Any further deception on our part would just make it worse. \n \u201cSorry, Horikita. We planned this.\u201d \n \u201cI thought as much. I thought this whole thing was a little suspicious right from the start.\u201d \n \u201cHorikita-san. Please be my friend!\u201d Kushida just came out and asked her directly, no longer trying to hide anything. \n \u201cI\u2019ve already said this many times. I want you to leave me alone. I have no intention of becoming friends with anyone in class. Can you not understand that?\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cAlways being alone is a very sad way to spend your life. I just want to get along with everyone in class.\u201d \n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t deny you your wish, but it\u2019s wrong to try forcing people into something against their will. Being alone doesn\u2019t make me sad.\u201d \n \u201cB-but\u2026\u201d \n \u201cBesides, do you think that I would be happy if you forced me to become your friend? Do you think that feelings of trust would arise out of something forced?\u201d \n Horikita wasn\u2019t wrong. It wasn\u2019t that she couldn\u2019t make friends, but that she considered them unnecessary. Kushida wanted something, but Horikita would not reciprocate. \n \u201cIt\u2019s my fault for not being clear enough with you, so I don\u2019t blame you this time. But if you try this again, please keep in mind that I will not forgive you.\u201d \n As she said that, Horikita took her untouched latte and stood up. \n \u201cHorikita-san, whatever you say, I really want to be friends with you. When I saw you, I felt like it wasn\u2019t the first time we\u2019d met. I wondered if you felt the same way,\u201d Kushida mumbled. \n \u201cThis is a waste of time. I find everything you\u2019re saying unpleasant.\u201d Horikita raised her voice, cutting Kushida off without mercy. Even though I\u2019d told Kushida I would help her, I had absolutely no intention of butting in. But\u2026 \n \u201cI kind of understand your thoughts on the matter, Horikita. I\u2019ve actually often wondered if friends are really necessary,\u201d I said. \n \u201c You\u2019re saying that? You\u2019ve been trying to make friends since day one.\u201d \n \u201cI won\u2019t deny it. However, you and I are similar. I wasn\u2019t able to make friends until I came to this school. In junior high, I never knew anyone\u2019s contact information or hung out with anyone after class. I was always alone.\u201d \n Kushida was visibly surprised when she heard me say that, like she couldn\u2019t believe it. \n \u201cI think that partly explains why I was compelled to talk to you,\u201d I said. \n \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard something like that. However, even if you and I share some things in common, I think we took different paths to reach this point. You wanted friends but couldn\u2019t get them. I considered friends unnecessary, so I didn\u2019t make any. Saying we are similar would be incorrect. Am I wrong?\u201d \n \u201cNo. But telling Kushida that she was being unpleasant is going too far. Are you really okay with this? If you choose not to get along with anyone else, you\u2019ll be alone for the next three years. That sounds pretty painful.\u201d \n \u201cIt will be my ninth year in a row of being alone, so I\u2019ll be fine. Oh, and if you include kindergarten, it would actually be slightly longer.\u201d \n Had she just nonchalantly dropped a bombshell? That she\u2019d always been alone for as long as she could remember? \n \u201cCan I go now?\u201d Horikita asked. \n She sighed deeply and looked straight into Kushida\u2019s eyes. \n \u201cKushida-san, if you don\u2019t try to force me into anything, I won\u2019t be rude. I promise. You\u2019re not stupid, so you understand what I\u2019m telling you, right?\u201d \n With one final simple \u201c Well then ,\u201d Horikita left. Kushida and I remained in the noisy cafe. \n \u201cWell, that was a failure. I tried to lend a helping land, but it was pointless. I guess she\u2019s gotten too accustomed to being alone,\u201d I said. \n Kushida wordlessly collapsed into her seat. However, she instantly recovered, and her usual smile returned. \n \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Thank you, Ayanokouji-kun. It\u2019s true that I wasn\u2019t able to become her friend, but\u2026I was able to learn something important. That\u2019s enough for me. I\u2019m sorry, though. I feel like Horikita-san might hate you now because you helped me.\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I just wanted Horikita to consider the benefits of friendship.\u201d Thinking it\u2019d be inconsiderate for the two us to hold up table space for four people, I moved to sit next to Kushida. \n \u201cEven so, I was shocked when you said that you didn\u2019t have any friends, Ayanokouji-kun. Is that true? I didn\u2019t think you were like that at all. Why were you all alone?\u201d \n \u201cHmm? Oh, yeah, it\u2019s true. Sudou and Ike are the first friends I\u2019ve ever made. I still don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s my fault or the fault of the circumstances I was in.\u201d \n \u201cBut when you made friends, did it make you happy? Is it fun?\u201d Kushida asked. \n \u201cYeah. There are times when I find it annoying, but sometimes I feel like I\u2019m happier than I was before.\u201d \n Kushida\u2019s eyes sparkled as she smiled at me, nodding her head in agreement. \n \u201cHorikita has her own way of thinking. There\u2019s probably nothing that we can do about that.\u201d \n \u201cDo you really think so? Is it not possible to make friends with her?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cWhy are you desperate to be her friend? Kushida, don\u2019t you already have more friends than everyone else? There\u2019s no reason to focus on Horikita.\u201d \n Even if it meant that she wouldn\u2019t be friends with everyone in class, she didn\u2019t need to try so desperately. \n \u201cI wanted to be friends with everyone. Not just the people in Class D, but the students from other classes, too. But if I can\u2019t become friends with one girl in my class, then that means I\u2019ll never achieve my goal\u2026\u201d \n \u201cJust think of Horikita as a special case. Your only option is to wait for a real coincidence to come along.\u201d \n Not something forced, but a natural event that would connect the two of them. When that time came, they might possibly become friends. \n "], "Chapter 52": ["==============="], "Chapter 53": ["Chapter 6: The End of Everyday Life \n \u201cH a ha ha ha! God, you\u2019re so dumb. You\u2019re hilarious, man!\u201d \n Ike chatted loudly with Yamauchi during second-period math. It\u2019d been three weeks since the entrance ceremony. In that time, Ike and Yamauchi, along with Sudou, had collectively come to be known as \u201cThe Idiot Trio.\u201d \n \u201cHey, hey, do you want to go do karaoke?\u201d \n \u201cYeah, let\u2019s go!\u201d \n A group of girls nearby were making plans for after class. \n \u201cI was really worried for a while, but it looks like everyone\u2019s opened up to each other quickly.\u201d \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun, haven\u2019t you made quite a few friends?\u201d asked Horikita, copying what was written on the blackboard into her notebook. \n \u201cSomewhat, I suppose.\u201d \n Although I was anxious at first, I\u2019d gotten to know Sudou from our encounter at the convenience store, and I\u2019d bonded with Ike and Yamauchi through the incident at the pool. Sometimes we ate lunch together. Even though I was far from having a best friend, before I knew it, I could say that I had some friends. Human relationships are rather mysterious, so I couldn\u2019t pinpoint the precise moment we became friends. \n \u201cSup?\u201d Halfway through class, Sudou crashed through the door and barged into the classroom. He slumped in his seat with a yawn, clearly not caring how late he was. \n \u201cOh, hey, Sudou. Wanna get lunch later?\u201d Ike called out to Sudou from across the room. \n The math teacher continued the lesson without even really paying attention. Normally, the teacher would have flicked a piece of chalk at him, but perhaps out of some feeling of laissez faire , all of the teachers tolerated that kind of behavior. Even when it came to poor language, being late to class, or dozing off, no one cared. While at first our class had acted more reserved, now everyone was far too flippant. Of course, there were a few students like Horikita who studied diligently. \n My cell phone vibrated in my pocket, indicating that I\u2019d received a message. It was from the guys\u2019 group chat that I was a part of. It looked like they\u2019d decided to eat lunch in the dining hall. \n \u201cHey, Horikita. Do you want to have lunch with me?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cI will have to decline. Your group is rather unrefined, anyway.\u201d \n \u201cI can\u2019t deny that.\u201d \n When guys were alone, all they talked about were girls and dirty jokes. Who\u2019s cute, who\u2019s going out with who, how far they\u2019ve gone, etc. Adding a girl into the group would probably have been a bad idea. \n \u201cWhoa. Seriously, he has a girlfriend? Awesome.\u201d \n Based on Ike\u2019s conversation, it sounded like Hirata was dating Karuizawa. Watching Karuizawa from afar, I saw that she was gazing lovingly at him from across the room. As for my own impression of Karuizawa, well, she was certainly cute. But she had this atmosphere around her that it made difficult for uncertain people to approach her. In other words, she seemed like one of those intensely \u201cgirly\u201d-type girls. In junior high, she\u2019d probably pounced on pretty boys like Hirata. These were my own uncharitable assumptions, but I probably wasn\u2019t far off. \n Oops. I had pretty mean-spirited opinions about her, although, not really to the extent that it would be considered defamation. I apologized to Karuizawa in my head. \n \u201cI hate that look on your face.\u201d \n Horikita glared icily at me. She must have read my sleazy inner thoughts. How fast did you need to move to become a couple right after starting school? I was agonizing over just making friends. If I\u2019d gone up to Horikita and asked, \u201cWould you go out with me?\u201d she definitely would\u2019ve smacked me. At any rate, if I were to get a girlfriend, I\u2019d prefer a kinder, more ladylike girl. \n "], "Chapter 54": ["==============="], "Chapter 55": ["6.1 \n F or third period, we had history class with Chiyabashira-sensei. When the bell rang, Chiyabashira-sensei walked into the noisy classroom. Her entrance didn\u2019t alter the students\u2019 behavior. \n \u201cQuiet down a little, please. Today\u2019s lesson will be a bit serious.\u201d \n \u201cWhat do you mean, Sae-chan-sensei?\u201d \n They already had a pet name for the teacher. \n \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the month, so we\u2019re going to have a short test. Please pass these to the back.\u201d \n She handed out the papers to the students in the front row. Eventually, the single-sheet test reached my desk. It contained questions in the five main subjects. With only a few questions per subject, it really was short. \n \u201cHuh? I wasn\u2019t listening, though. This is so unfair!\u201d a student cried. \n \u201cDon\u2019t say that. This test is just for future reference. It won\u2019t be reflected in your report cards. There is no risk involved, so don\u2019t worry. Of course, cheating is prohibited.\u201d \n Her phrasing struck me as odd. Normally, only general grades were reflected in your report card. But the way Chiyabashira-sensei said they wouldn\u2019t be reflected in our report cards made me think that the grade could be reflected in some other way. Well\u2026perhaps I was worrying too much. If this had no effect on our report card, then there was no need to be so cautious. \n As soon as the pop quiz began, I scanned the questions. There were four questions per subject, for a total of twenty. Each question was worth five points, for a total of one hundred points. Most of the questions were extraordinarily easy, to the point where it was almost a letdown. In fact, the questions seemed to be about two levels less difficult than the ones on the entrance examination. It appeared far too easy. \n However, just as I thought that, I reached the end of the test. The final three questions were an order of magnitude higher in terms of difficulty. The final math problem couldn\u2019t be solved without complex formulae. \n \u201cNo way. These questions are seriously way too hard\u2026\u201d \n These questions couldn\u2019t be geared toward a first-year high school student. The final three questions were clearly of a different quality than the others, so it was possible they\u2019d been put on the test by mistake. Even though the results wouldn\u2019t be reflected in our grades, what in the hell were they evaluating with this? \n Well, I guess I\u2019ll just solve these problems the same way I did on the entrance exam. \n Chiyabashira-sensei monitored us. As she slowly patrolled the classroom, she kept a watchful eye to dissuade us from cheating. I quickly glanced at Horikita, who would never even think of cheating. Her pen danced across the paper as she filled in all of the answers. It looked like she was easily going to get a perfect score. \n I continued staring intently at my test until the bell rang. \n "], "Chapter 56": ["==============="], "Chapter 57": ["6.2 \n \u201cI f you just come right out and tell me straight, I\u2019ll forgive you, okay?\u201d \n \u201cTell you what straight?\u201d \n After we\u2019d finished lunch, I was chatting with Sudou and the other guys next to the vending machine in the hall. All of a sudden, Ike sidled up next to me. \n \u201cWe\u2019re friends, right? Comrades that stick together through thick and thin?\u201d \n \u201cUh, yeah. I guess so.\u201d \n \u201cSo then, naturally\u2026you would tell us if you got yourself a girlfriend, right?\u201d he asked. \n \u201cHuh? A girlfriend? Well, sure. If that happens, I will.\u201d \n Ike put his arm over my shoulder. \n \u201cCome on. You\u2019re going out with Horikita, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m not gonna forgive you if you get ahead of us!\u201d \n \u201cHuh?\u201d \n I noticed Yamauchi and Sudou both eyeing me suspiciously. \n \u201cYou idiot. We\u2019re not dating. Absolutely not. Seriously.\u201d \n \u201cOkay, but what were you guys talking about all sneaky-like during class today? I guess it\u2019s not a story for us, huh? Were you talking about dates or making plans for dates, huh?! Ah, I could kill you, I\u2019m so jealous!\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Besides, Horikita isn\u2019t the dating type.\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. We never really talked to her before. If Kushida hadn\u2019t brought it up, we probably wouldn\u2019t even know her name. She disappears into the background, like a shadow.\u201d \n Was that true? I couldn\u2019t recall Horikita really talking to anyone except for Kushida or me. \n \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even know her name? That\u2019s awful.\u201d \n \u201cSo, do you know all your classmate\u2019s names, Ayanokouji?\u201d \n I could remember about half of their names. I got the point. \n \u201cShe does have a really cute face though, doesn\u2019t she? That\u2019s why we noticed her.\u201d \n Yamauchi and the guys nodded in agreement. \n \u201cShe has such an uptight personality, though. I don\u2019t like girls like her,\u201d remarked Sudou, drinking his coffee. \n \u201cYeah, I know. It\u2019s like she\u2019s really snippy, yeah? I\u2019d rather go out with a cheerful girl who I can have an easy conversation with. She has to be cute, of course. Just like Kushida-chan.\u201d Of course. Kushida was still Ike\u2019s favorite. \n \u201cAhh. To go out with Kushida-chan\u2026or rather, do naughty stuff with her!\u201d cried Yamauchi. \n \u201cYou moron! Like hell you can date Kushida-chan! And you\u2019re forbidden from fantasizing about her, too!\u201d Ike cried. \n \u201cCome on, you think you can date her, Ike? Besides, I\u2019ve dreamt of sleeping next to Kushida-chan!\u201d \n \u201cWhat?! Well, I\u2019ve dreamt of her doing super sexy poses while in cosplay!\u201d \n The two of them went back and forth over their wild Kushida fantasies. Come on, guys. High school students are free to fantasize, but that\u2019s just being plain rude to Kushida. \n \u201cWho do you have your eye on, Sudou? Seen any cute girls in basketball?\u201d Ike asked. \n \u201cHuh? Oh, no one. Not yet, anyway. We don\u2019t really have room for any girls on the team right now.\u201d \n \u201cReally? If you do have a girlfriend, though, you better not be hiding it! You have to tell us! You have to!\u201d \n \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Sudou said. Despite how disgusted he seemed by the conversation, he nodded. \n The subject of girlfriends made me remember Hirata. \n \u201cOh, yeah, isn\u2019t Hirata dating Karuizawa now?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Hondou saw them holding hands just the other day!\u201d \n \u201cYeah, they\u2019re dating. No mistake about it. They were walking together, shoulder to shoulder.\u201d \n \u201cThey were, huh? I wonder if they\u2019ve already done naughty stuff together.\u201d \n \u201cOf course they have! Ah, I\u2019m so jealous! I\u2019m too jealous!\u201d \n It felt kind of unbelievable that a first-year high school student would already have had sex. But I supposed it was true. \n Unintentionally, I\u2019d started thinking like these guys. \n \u201cListen to me. I\u2019ve got the most experience with sex and stuff,\u201d said Yamauchi, sprawled out on the hallway floor. \n \u201cI think it\u2019d be better to ask Hirata,\u201d Ike said. \n \u201cDo you honestly think that Hirata would give us the details? Like, if we asked about her breasts, or if she were a virgin, or things like that? Do you really think he\u2019d tell us? Come on,\u201d I said. \n What kind of experiences were they planning to ask about? \n I walked over to the nearby vending machine to buy something to drink. \n \u201cGet me some cocoa!\u201d Yamauchi called. \n \u201cIf you want something, buy it yourself.\u201d \n \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve already almost used up all of my points. I have about 2,000 left.\u201d \n \u201cHow could you possibly have used more than 90,000 points in just three weeks?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cI bought stuff I wanted. Here, check it out. It\u2019s awesome!\u201d said Yamauchi, taking out a handheld gaming device. \n \u201cI bought this with Ike. It\u2019s a PS Viva! A PS VIVA! It\u2019s amazing that a school sells this kind of stuff.\u201d \n \u201cHow much did it cost?\u201d \n \u201cAbout 20,000. With the optional stuff included, it came to about 25,000.\u201d \n Dude, don\u2019t spend all of your points right away. \n \u201cI don\u2019t usually play games all that much, but now that I\u2019m living in a dorm, I figured I could play with friends. Oh, you know that Miyamoto guy in our class? He\u2019s really good at video games.\u201d \n Miyamoto was the rather plump boy. I\u2019d never spoken to him directly, but I got the impression he was the type who\u2019d talk about things like games and anime all the time. \n \u201cYou should buy one too and join in. Sudou said that he\u2019d get one with next month\u2019s allowance.\u201d \n They were already ganging up on me. Yamauchi handed over his game system so I could give it a try. It was a lot lighter than I expected. The screen displayed a warrior, huge sword strapped to his back, petting a pig. What kind of world was this? \n \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not really that interested. What\u2026 is this, anyway? Some kind of fighting game?\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019ve heard about Hunter Watch , right? It\u2019s sold more than 4.8 million copies worldwide, man! I\u2019ve had an incredible knack for games ever since I was a little kid. Overseas professionals constantly scouted me. I always turned them down, though.\u201d \n You can proclaim something a worldwide phenomenon, but whether or not it\u2019s actually good is another matter. There were about seven billion people in the world. The people who\u2019d purchased this game accounted for less than 0.1 percent of the global population. \n \u201cAnyway, how in the world can such a delicate girl wear such heavy equipment? Is her armor plastic or something? If it were iron, even someone with Sudou\u2019s physique would struggle with it.\u201d \n \u201cAyanokouji, you really want an element of realism in your games? What, are you a foreigner? People who say that kind of stuff are usually okay with games where you can automatically regenerate your life. Are you one of those? Do you want some Western-developed game where you shoot guys then hide somewhere and get all of your health back? Because, if you ask me, those games are unrealistic!\u201d \n I couldn\u2019t understand Yamauchi at all. \n \u201cWell, you know what they say: \u2018seeing is believing,\u2019 right? Just try it. When you start playing, we\u2019ll help you farm for materials. Collecting honey is hard work, you know? So you can buy me some cocoa, then.\u201d \n \u201cFor crying out loud\u2026\u201d \n I didn\u2019t exactly need the honey, but I bought the cocoa to avoid any further hassle. \n \u201cAh, friendship is such a blessing! Thank you!\u201d Yamauchi said. \n I didn\u2019t want that kind of friendship. I tossed the cocoa to Yamauchi, who caught it against his stomach. Now, what did I want to drink? Hesitating, I noticed a button on the machine. \n \u201cOh, so they have this, too.\u201d \n There was a button for mineral water, which was free of charge. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \n \u201cOh, nothing. Just was wondering if the cafeteria offers anything for free.\u201d \n \u201cOh, you mean like the vegetable meal set? Ugh, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d want to go through school with only vegetables and water.\u201d \n Yamauchi cackled as he drank his cocoa. If you used up all of your points, then you\u2019d have no choice but to take the free stuff, like vegetables and water. However, it was easy to avoid that situation. As long as you didn\u2019t spend all of your points like Yamauchi, that is. \n \u201cThere are quite a few people who eat the vegetables, actually,\u201d I said. \n Since I went to the cafeteria often, I recalled seeing many students eating the free meal sets. \n \u201cIt\u2019s not because they like it. It\u2019s probably because it\u2019s the end of the month.\u201d \n \u201cWell, that might be so.\u201d While I felt a little uneasy about it, I pressed the button for milk and took the bottle after it came tumbling down. \n \u201cAh, why can\u2019t next month come any faster? I want my dream life back again!\u201d Yamauchi and the other guys laughed as they lamented. \n "], "Chapter 58": ["==============="], "Chapter 59": ["6.3 \n H EY, we\u2019re going to go hang out with Kushida-chan and some other people after class. You want to come? \n I received that text message in the middle of my afternoon class while absentmindedly jotting down notes. Ah, weren\u2019t these supposed to be the halcyon days of our youth? This was the first time that friends had invited me to hang out after class. I had no reason to refuse their invitation, but I thought I\u2019d ask who was going. \n I mean, I didn\u2019t want to be surrounded by a bunch of people I didn\u2019t know. That would be awkward. \n I quickly received a reply. I saw Ike and Yamauchi\u2019s names, as well as Kushida\u2019s. Including me, that made five people. Didn\u2019t seem like anyone whom I didn\u2019t already know was included. Well, that sounded fine. I confirmed that I\u2019d go, and a response quickly followed. \n Kushida-chan is my target, so don\u2019t you dare get in my way! \u2013Ike-sama \n No, no, Kushida-chan is mine. You stay out of the way! \u2013Yamauchi \n Huh? You say you\u2019re after Kushida-chan, too?! What, are you trying to pick a fight? \n It\u2019d be nice if we all got along, but the two of them started fighting over Kushida via text. I\u2019d been looking forward to hanging out with everyone, but now I thought it might be a hassle. When class ended, I left with Ike and Yamauchi. Even though I\u2019d been here a while, the school grounds were so expansive that I still didn\u2019t know the area very well. \n \u201cWe couldn\u2019t leave with Kushida even though we\u2019re in the same class, huh?\u201d I said. \n \u201cShe said she had to talk to a friend from another class. Kushida-chan is quite popular.\u201d \n \u201cDo you think maybe she\u2019s talking to a boy?\u201d Ike mumbled. \n \u201cRelax, Ike. I\u2019ve already confirmed it. She\u2019s talking to a girl,\u201d Yamauchi said. \n \u201cAll right, all right.\u201d \n \u201cAre you guys seriously going after Kushida?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cOf course. She\u2019s my dream girl.\u201d \n Yamauchi must have shared this opinion, considering the fact he kept nodding in agreement. \n \u201cYou\u2019re interested in Horikita, aren\u2019t you? She\u2019s definitely beautiful, I gotta say.\u201d \n \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Really.\u201d \n \u201cReally? Didn\u2019t you guys sneakily exchange looks and nonchalantly touch fingertips? You know, something bittersweet and yet kind of irritating?\u201d \n While Ike relentlessly pressed me, one of the very girls we were talking about ran over. \n \u201cSorry for being late, but thanks for waiting!\u201d Kushida cried. \n \u201cOh, no worries, Kushida-chan! Hey, wait a second, why are they here?!\u201d Ike had been jumping up and down excitedly, but now he tumbled over and sprawled across the ground. What an energetic guy. \n \u201cOh, I just happened to run into them on the way, so I thought I\u2019d invite them along. Was that not okay?\u201d \n Kushida had brought Hirata and his girlfriend (at least, I was pretty sure she was his girlfriend), Karuizawa. There were also two other girls, Matsushita and Mori, who always hung around Karuizawa. \n \u201cHey, don\u2019t we have some way of making Hirata go away?!\u201d Ike whispered, putting his arm around my shoulder. \n \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any reason to make him leave,\u201d I replied. \n \u201cThat pretty boy will completely overshadow us! What are you going to do if Kushida-chan ends up liking Hirata, huh?! We can\u2019t let that pretty boy end up with a cutie like Kushida!\u201d \n \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about\u2026 Hey, wait, isn\u2019t Hirata dating Karuizawa? I wouldn\u2019t worry.\u201d \n \u201cHey, just because you say he has a girlfriend is no guarantee. I can\u2019t relax. Besides, anyone in his right mind would choose a pretty angel like Kushida-chan over a sloppy, easy gal like Karuizawa!\u201d \n Ike furiously prattled on, his spit spraying my ear, which grossed me out. Not just the spit, either; his vile words were pretty disgusting, too. It was true that Karuizawa certainly was one of those gyaru types with tanned skin and everything, but she was plenty cute. \n \u201cHey, Ike, you do know that there\u2019s no guarantee that Kushida-chan is a virgin, right?\u201d Yamauchi joined our conversation, his anxious voice a strained whisper. \n \u201cW-well\u2026 Yeah, you might be\u2026 N-no, Kushida has to be a virgin!\u201d Ike said. \n They continued to discuss their wild, delusional fantasies, though I thought it was more misogyny than anything. If at all possible, I would\u2019ve rather not been involved. \n \u201cUm, if we\u2019re a bother, perhaps we can just go separately?\u201d said Hirata in a reserved tone. He seemed to have noticed our secret conversation. \n \u201cW-we don\u2019t really mind at all, do we? Right, Yamauchi?\u201d \n \u201cY-yeah. Let\u2019s all go together. The more the merrier, you know. Right, Ike?\u201d \n Moments ago, those two had shouted that others would \u201cbe in the way\u201d and that they needed to get rid of Hirata. But if they did such a thing, then Kushida might like them less. Whether or not there was any chance she\u2019d like them in the first place was another matter. \n \u201cWell, obviously, that was the idea. Why are you three whispering about us?\u201d Karuizawa\u2019s words were certainly understandable, but I was shocked to be lumped together with Ike and Yamauchi. \n \u201cWell, here\u2019s my thought. If we include Hirata and Karuizawa, then we\u2019ll have the same number of boys and girls. So that means it\u2019d be a triple date. Ayanokouji, this could be your chance, you know?\u201d \n \u201cSo, you\u2019re good with Matsushita, Yamauchi? I\u2019m gonna talk to Kushida-chan,\u201d Ike said. \n \u201cHey, don\u2019t screw with me! I\u2019m the one after Kushida-chan! We\u2019re going to get married under an old cherry blossom tree, exchanging vows like a sweet promise between childhood friends! It\u2019s fate!\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re full of crap! I\u2019ve thought about doing that for a while now. You\u2019re a total liar!\u201d \n \u201cHuh? It\u2019s all true, all of it!\u201d \n If you were to believe everything Yamauchi Haruki said, then he had been a skilled gamer since childhood, scouted by professionals from overseas, and a national ping pong competitor. Then, in junior high, he\u2019d been his baseball team\u2019s ace player and a promising future star. What an incredibly gifted man. \n Though there was no confirmation that any of that was the truth. \n I didn\u2019t know where we were headed, so I quietly hung to the back of the group. While Ike and Yamauchi daydreamed about Kushida, they flanked Hirata on both sides. \n \u201cI\u2019m just going to ask you, Hirata. Are you going out with Karuizawa?\u201d Ike asked point-blank to determine whether or not Hirata was his enemy. \n \u201cUh\u2026where did you hear that?\u201d Hirata asked. As expected, he looked a little surprised, or even panicked, by that question. \u201cOh, guess you figured it out, huh? Yeah, we\u2019re dating.\u201d \n Karuizawa latched onto Hirata\u2019s arm before he could say anything. Hirata just lightly scratched his cheek, as if signaling resignation. \n \u201cSeriously?! I\u2019m so jealous that you\u2019re dating such a cute girl like Karuizawa!\u201d said Yamauchi, feigning envy. You\u2019d think that lying while being unaware that you\u2019re lying would be easy, but it was surprisingly difficult. \n \u201cKushida-chan, do you have a boyfriend?\u201d Ike managed to shift attention over to Kushida without missing a beat. Pretty clever, huh? \n \u201cMe? Oh, no, unfortunately,\u201d she said. \n Both Ike and Yamauchi clearly rejoiced, breaking out in massive grins. Their joy leaked out for everyone to see. Although it was possible that Kushida was hiding the fact that she had a boyfriend, she\u2019d basically confirmed that she was available. I was a little glad to hear that, too. \n \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m crying\u2026\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Yamauchi! We\u2019re finally almost at the summit!\u201d \n Their destination no longer waited at the peak of an insurmountable mountain, but instead at the end of a precipitous path\u2026 \n Hirata, Karuizawa, Ike, and Yamauchi all surrounded Kushida as they walked. The rather uninteresting pair of Matsushita and Mori followed behind the main group, while I walked farther behind them, alone. \n \u201cHey, Ike. Where are we going?\u201d someone asked. \n \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long since the entrance ceremony, remember? Just wanted to check out the campus facilities,\u201d Ike answered, seemingly irritated. \n So, there was no clear destination, which meant that this somewhat awkward experience would go on for a while\u2026 \n My unpleasant expectations unexpectedly changed. \n \u201cHey, Matsushita-san, Mori-san. What do you two want to go see?\u201d \n While Ike and Yamauchi happily chatted with each other, Kushida fell back to talk to the other two girls. \n \u201cHuh? Oh, um, well\u2026I\u2019ve wanted to see the movie theater at least once.\u201d \n \u201cYeah. Since school\u2019s done for the day, I wanted to go, too.\u201d \n \u201cOh, yeah! I\u2019ve wanted to go as well, but haven\u2019t gotten around to it yet. Karuizawa-san, have you gone to any special places on dates?\u201d \n Kushida started to organize us into three groups, just as I\u2019d expect of her. No matter how hard I tried, I could never have done something like that. Also, as a nice bonus, she occasionally turned and smiled sweetly at me. I didn\u2019t expect that. \n I tried not to talk unnecessarily, as I felt that would just be a hassle. I tried to look at Kushida in a way that showed I wasn\u2019t ignoring her. If Kushida couldn\u2019t read the room, and merely liked being the constant center of attention, then the message probably wouldn\u2019t reach her. \n However, there are people who will lash out and say something like, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you read the situation?\u201d to a friend after he refuses to do karaoke, even though they know that friend said he didn\u2019t want to sing. There are, after all, self-absorbed, simple-minded people who assume that because karaoke is fun for them, that means everyone will love it. They simply cannot comprehend that some people dislike singing. \n While I\u2019d been mulling over this venomous topic, my surroundings had changed. Apparently, we\u2019d stopped at a clothing store on campus. More precisely, it was a boutique. Everyone seemed to have come to this store a few times already, so we entered without hesitation. Generally, I wore my uniform on weekdays, and since I usually stayed in my dorm on my days off, I hadn\u2019t bought any clothes for going out. \n There were many students inside, though few upperclassmen. The majority appeared to be first-year students. Perhaps it was because of my newness, but I felt really inexperienced and anxious in this atmosphere. We checked out many different items on the racks and, afterward, went to a nearby caf\u00e9. Hirata carried the clothes that Karuizawa had purchased, which cost about 30,000 points. \n \u201cHave you all gotten used to this school yet?\u201d \n \u201cAt first, I was really perplexed, but now I\u2019ve settled in perfectly. It\u2019s like living in a dream. I don\u2019t ever want to graduate!\u201d \n \u201cHa ha! I get the feeling Ike-kun is enjoying his time here to the fullest!\u201d \n \u201cI just wish we had more points, you know? Maybe 200,000 or 300,000 a month? After buying cosmetics and clothes and stuff, I\u2019ve already used up almost all of my points,\u201d Karuizawa said. \n \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s abnormal for a high school student to get 300,000 points as a monthly allowance?\u201d Hirata asked. \n \u201cWell, if you put it like that, yeah. Even 100,000 is pretty outlandish. I\u2019m a little scared, to be honest. I\u2019m worried about what life after graduation will be like if I keep on spending my school days like this.\u201d \n \u201cDo you mean you\u2019ll lose your sense of money management? Yeah, that does sound pretty scary, actually.\u201d \n Everyone felt differently about our monthly allowance. Karuizawa and Ike both wanted more points, while Hirata and Kushida were terrified of what would happen when our life of luxury ended. \n \u201cWhat about you, Ayanokouji-kun? Do you think that 100,000 points is a lot or not enough?\u201d \n At that point, I\u2019d only intended to listen, but Kushida asked me my thoughts. \n \u201cHmm, well, I don\u2019t really fully understand it yet. I\u2019m not sure,\u201d I replied. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d \n \u201cI think I understand what you\u2019re getting at, Ayanokouji-kun. This is honestly completely different from any normal school. It\u2019s hard to understand it without really knowing all the details.\u201d \n \u201cWell, there\u2019s no point worrying about it. I\u2019m super glad that I got into this school. I can just go out and buy whatever I want. In fact, yesterday I went out and bought some new clothes.\u201d Ike lived a positive life, always forging directly ahead. \n \u201cKushida-chan and Hirata aside, Ike, you and Karuizawa also managed to get into this place. Aren\u2019t you guys pretty dumb, though?\u201d \n \u201cYou don\u2019t strike me as being very smart either, Yamauchi.\u201d \n \u201cHuh? I\u2019ll have you know that I scored 900 points on the APEC .\u201d \n \u201cWhat\u2019s the APEC ?\u201d \n \u201cYou don\u2019t even know? It\u2019s a super tough test for English.\u201d \n \u201cUm, don\u2019t you mean the TOEIC , not APEC ?\u201d \n Kushida gently brought Yamauchi back down to earth. APEC actually stood for Asia-Pacific Economic Partnership. \n \u201cTh-they\u2019re related though, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he asked. \n They were as far apart as it\u2019s possible to get. \n \u201cWell, this school\u2019s mission is to nurture young people who will pave the way to the future, right? So, they probably don\u2019t choose people solely on their test scores. Honestly, if this school only took in people based on standardized tests, I wouldn\u2019t have taken the entrance exam.\u201d \n \u201cYeah, yeah. Young people who will pave the way to the future. That\u2019s exactly how I\u2019d describe myself.\u201d Ike crossed his arms and nodded. \n Despite being the premier institution in Japan, with stellar rates of advancement into higher education and employment, this school didn\u2019t appear to determine the criteria for passing or failing through test scores. If that was the case, then how in the world did it select potential students? I found myself suddenly curious. \n "], "Chapter 60": ["==============="], "Chapter 61": ["Chapter 7: Classroom of the Elite \n O n May 1, the morning bell rang for our very first day of class. Soon afterward, Chiyabashira-sensei strode into the room, holding a rolled-up poster. Her expression today was even more stern than usual. Had she started menopause, I wondered? If I made that joke out loud, I think she would have swung an iron bat at my face with full force. \n \u201cHey, sensei, did you start menopause or something?\u201d \n Unbelievably, Ike actually let that joke fly. Honestly, it was more shocking that I\u2019d thought the same thing as Ike. \n \u201cAll right, your morning homeroom is about to begin. Before we get started, does anyone have any questions? If so, now is the time to speak.\u201d Chiyabashira-sensei completely ignored Ike\u2019s sexual harassment. She appeared totally convinced that the students had questions they wanted answered. Immediately, several students raised their hands. \n \u201cUm, I checked my point balance this morning, but I didn\u2019t see any deposits. Points are given on the first day of every month, aren\u2019t they? I couldn\u2019t buy juice this morning.\u201d \n \u201cHondou, I already explained this before, didn\u2019t I? Points are deposited on the first day of the month. I\u2019ve confirmed that points were wired this month without any issues.\u201d \n \u201cUm, but\u2026nothing was deposited into my account, though.\u201d \n Hondou and Yamauchi exchanged glances. Ike appeared too shocked to notice them looking at each other. I\u2019d checked my point balance that morning as well, but saw that it had remained unchanged from the day before. No more points had been deposited into my account. I\u2019d simply thought that the points would be wired later. \n \u201cAre you kids really that dumb?\u201d \n Was she angry or delighted? I was getting an ominous vibe from Chiyabashira-sensei. \n \u201cDumb? What?\u201d \n As Hondou stupidly repeated her words, Chiyabashira-sensei looked at him sharply. \n \u201cSit down, Hondou. I\u2019ll explain once more,\u201d she said. \n \u201cS-Sae-chan-sensei?\u201d \n Hondou, taken aback by her unusually strict tone, slumped in his seat. \n \u201cPoints were deposited. That much I know for certain. There is absolutely no chance that we forgot about anyone in this class. To think so is ludicrous. Understood?\u201d \n \u201cWell, even if I tell you that we understand, we haven\u2019t received any points\u2026\u201d \n Hondou, still perplexed, began to look dissatisfied. Supposing that what Chiyabashira-sensei said was true and that points had been wired to us, then that meant\u2026 \n Had there been a discrepancy, then? Did that mean that zero points had been deposited into our accounts? My vague doubts quickly grew. \n \u201cHa ha ha! I see. So, it\u2019s like that then, teacher? I think I\u2019ve solved the mystery,\u201d Kouenji boomed, laughing. \n He propped his feet up on his desk and smugly pointed toward Hondou. \n \u201cIt\u2019s simple. We\u2019re in Class D, so we didn\u2019t receive a single point.\u201d \n \u201cHuh? What are you talking about? They said that we\u2019d get 100,000 points every month\u2014\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t remember hearing that, though. Do you?\u201d Chuckling, Kouenji boldly pointed at Chiyabashira-sensei. \n \u201cWhile he certainly has an attitude problem, Kouenji is exactly right. For crying out loud, barely anyone seems to have noticed the hint I gave you. How deplorable.\u201d \n In response to this sudden turn of events, the classroom exploded in an uproar. \n \u201cSensei, may I please ask you a question? I\u2019m afraid I still don\u2019t understand.\u201d Hirata raised his hand. He appeared to ask on behalf of his classmates rather than out of selfish concern. Just as I\u2019d expect of the de facto class leader. Even now, he took the initiative. \n \u201cCan you please tell us why we didn\u2019t receive any points? We won\u2019t completely understand otherwise.\u201d \n That was certainly true. \n \u201cA total of ninety-eight absences and late arrivals. Three hundred ninety-one incidences of talking or using a cell phone in class. That is quite a few infractions over one month. In this school, your class\u2019s results are reflected in the points that you receive . As a result, you wasted all of the 100,000 points that you should have received. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d \n \u201cI should have explained this all to you on the day of the entrance ceremony. This school measures its students\u2019 true abilities. This time, you were evaluated as being worth nothing. That\u2019s all.\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei spoke in a robotic fashion, devoid of any emotion. The doubts I\u2019d had since coming to this school were finally confirmed, though, in the worst way possible. Even though we\u2019d started with the huge advantage of 100,000 points, Class D had lost it in just a single month. \n "], "Chapter 62": ["==============="], "Chapter 63": [" filename=\"static\\uploads\\Classroom of the Elite - Volume 01 [Seven Seas][Kobo]\\images\\image14.jpg\"", "==============="], "Chapter 64": ["I heard a pencil moving against paper. Horikita seemed to be tallying the number of absences, tardy arrivals, and instances of talking in class down in her notebook, perhaps trying to make sense of the situation. \n \u201cChiyabashira-sensei. I do not recall hearing you explain that to us before\u2014\u201d \n \u201cWhat? Are you incapable of understanding something unless it\u2019s explained in detail?\u201d \n \u201cOf course. There was never any talk about reducing our points. Had that been explained beforehand, I\u2019m sure we would have avoided being late or talking during class.\u201d \n \u201cThat is a rather bizarre argument, Hirata. It is certainly true that I don\u2019t recall explaining the rules of point distribution. However, didn\u2019t you all learn in elementary school not to be late or talk in class? Was that not taught throughout your elementary and junior high schools?\u201d \n \u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m sure that in nine years of compulsory education, you learned that being late and talking in class are bad things. And now you say that you can\u2019t understand this because I haven\u2019t explained it to you? I\u2019m afraid your reasoning is flimsy. If you had simply acted properly, then your points would not have dropped all the way to zero. This comes down to you taking personal responsibility.\u201d \n There was no way for anyone to refute her perfectly sound argument. Everyone knew that bad behavior didn\u2019t pay. \n \u201cHaving just entered your first year of high school, did you honestly think you\u2019d receive 100,000 points every month with no strings attached? At a school established by the Japanese government for the express purposes of training gifted people? That\u2019s unthinkable. Try using some common sense. Why would you leave it to chance?\u201d \n Although Hirata appeared to be frustrated, he looked the teacher straight in the eye. \u201cWell then, could you at least explain in detail how points are added or deducted? We can keep that in mind for future reference.\u201d \n \u201cI cannot tell you. We cannot disclose the methods behind our student evaluation. It\u2019s the same as any other organization. When you enter a company, it is the company\u2019s choice whether or not to tell you how it evaluates its employees. However, I\u2019m not cruel, and I\u2019m not trying to be cold. In fact, this situation is so pathetic that I will give you one bit of guidance.\u201d \n For the first time, I saw a faint sliver of a smile on Chiyabashira-sensei\u2019s lips. \n \u201cLet\u2019s say that you stop being late to class and have no more absences\u2026 Even though zero points will be deducted from you this month, that doesn\u2019t mean that your points will increase, either. That means next month you will still receive zero points. From another perspective, you could say no matter how times you\u2019re late or absent to class, it doesn\u2019t matter. So, you\u2019re not really at a loss, are you?\u201d \n \u201cTch\u2026\u201d Hirata\u2019s expression darkened. Her explanation was so counterproductive that it had the opposite effect; some students seemed incapable of understanding what she meant. The students who thought they could improve their situation by remedying bad behavior had their hopes dashed. That was probably Chiyabashira-sensei\u2019s, or rather, this school\u2019s, intention. \n The bell rang, signaling the end of homeroom. \n \u201cIt looks like we spent too much time yammering. I hope that you understood the gist of it. Well, it\u2019s about time that we switch to our main topic.\u201d \n From the tube she carried, she removed a white rolled-up poster and spread it out. She stuck the poster to the blackboard with some magnets. The still-confused students stared blankly at the poster. \n \u201cAre these\u2026the results for each class?\u201d Horikita tentatively took a guess. She was probably right. Class A through Class D were listed. To the side was a row of numbers that went up to a maximum of four digits. Class D had zero. Class C had 490. Class B had 650. And at the top was Class A, with a total of 940. In this case, 1000 points would mean 100,000 yen, wouldn\u2019t it? Every class had apparently lost points. \n \u201cIsn\u2019t something about this odd?\u201d \n \u201cYeah. The numbers look too even.\u201d \n Horikita and I had both noticed something strange. \n \u201cYou\u2019ve all been doing whatever you pleased this past month. The school has no intention of preventing you from doing what you want. Your actions, such as being late or talking during class, only affect the points you receive. The same goes for how you use your points. How you choose to spend is entirely up to you. We have not put any restrictions on point usage.\u201d \n \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair, though! We can\u2019t enjoy our student lives like this!\u201d shouted Ike, who\u2019d stayed quiet until now. \n Yamauchi wailed in incredible agony. He\u2019d already used up all of his points\u2026 \n \u201cLook here, morons. Every other class got points. The amount of points we gave you for the first month should be plenty for you to live on.\u201d \n \u201cB-but, how do the other classes still have points left? That\u2019s weird\u2026\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019ve already told you, there\u2019s nothing unfair about it. All of the classes were scored using the same rules. Despite that, they didn\u2019t lose as many as you. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d \n \u201cBut\u2026why is there such a difference in our point values?\u201d Hirata also seemed to have noticed that the numbers were too tidy. \n \u201cDo you finally understand now? Do you see why you were placed in Class D?\u201d \n \u201cThe reason why we were placed in Class D? Weren\u2019t we simply accepted into this school?\u201d \n \u201cHuh? But classes are normally divided up like this, right?\u201d \n Students exchanged glances. \n \u201cIn this school, students are sorted by their level of excellence. The superior students are sorted into Class A, the least capable in Class D. It\u2019s the same system you\u2019d find in the major cram schools. In other words, Class D is akin to the last bastion for failures. You are the worst of the worst. You\u2019re defective. This is just the result of you being defective.\u201d \n Horikita\u2019s face stiffened. She appeared shocked by this line of reasoning. It certainly made sense to sort the superior students with the other superior students and the failures with the failures. If you mixed rotten oranges with good ones, the rotten would quickly spoil the good. Inevitably, the superior Horikita would find this revolting. \n I, on the other hand, was glad. This meant I couldn\u2019t go any lower. \n \u201cHowever, I have to say, this year\u2019s Class D was the first to ever spend all of their points in a single month. I am impressed by how much you indulged yourselves. Wonderful, just wonderful.\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei\u2019s false applause echoed throughout the classroom. \n \u201cSo, does that mean that once we reach zero points, we\u2019ll always stay there?\u201d \n \u201cYes. You will remain at zero until you graduate. But don\u2019t worry, you can still have a room in the dorms and free meals. You won\u2019t die.\u201d \n Although we knew that it was possible to get by with the bare minimum, a lot of students weren\u2019t comforted by that fact. After all, we\u2019d lived a life of luxury this past month. To suddenly restrain yourself after that would prove seriously difficult. \n \u201cWon\u2019t the other classes make fun of us?\u201d \n Sudou kicked the legs of his desk with a loud thwack . After hearing that the classes were divided based on merit, everyone else would probably believe that Class D was full of morons. Despair wasn\u2019t unreasonable. \n \u201cWhat? You\u2019re still worried about your dignity, Sudou? Well then, work to make your class into the best one.\u201d \n \u201cHuh?\u201d \n \u201cYour class\u2019s points aren\u2019t just linked to the amount of money that you receive each month. They\u2019re also indicative of your class rank.\u201d \n In other words\u2026should we get to 500 points, then Class D would be promoted to Class C. This really did sound like a company performance review. \n \u201cNow then, I have one more bit of bad news to share with you all.\u201d \n She stuck another sheet of paper up on the board. It listed the names of everyone in class. A number stood next to everyone\u2019s name. \n \u201cJudging from these, I can see that we\u2019ve quite a few idiots in this class.\u201d As her heels clacked against the floor, she glanced at us. \u201cThese are the results of the short test you took a while ago. Your sensei was so happy after your excellent performance. Come on, what in the world did you all study when you were in junior high?\u201d \n With the exception of a few high scores, almost everyone tested below a sixty. Even if you ignored Sudou\u2019s wonderful score of fourteen points, there was Ike, scoring a little above him at twenty-four points. The average score was sixty-five. \n \u201cI\u2019m so glad. If this were an actual test, then seven of you would\u2019ve had to drop out.\u201d \n \u201cD-drop out? What do you mean?\u201d \n \u201cOh, what, did I not explain this to you? If you fail on a midterm or final exam in this school, then you have to drop out. If we applied that rule to this test, anyone who scored below thirty-two points would be out. You guys really are stupid, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n \u201cWh-what?!\u201d wailed Ike and the other failures. \n There was a red line drawn on the paper, separating the seven people in question from the rest of the class. Among those seven people, Kikuchi had scored highest, with thirty-one points. Anyone with a score equal to or lower than Kikuchi\u2019s had failed. \n \u201cHey, don\u2019t jerk us around, Sae-chan-sensei! Don\u2019t joke about kicking us out!\u201d \n \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m also at a loss,\u201d the teacher said. \u201cThese are the school rules. You should prepare for the worst.\u201d \n \u201cThe teacher\u2019s right. There do seem to be a lot of morons here.\u201d Kouenji wore a smug grin while he polished his nails, his legs propped on the desk. \n \u201cWhat the hell, Kouenji? You scored below the red line, too!\u201d \n \u201cPah. Where exactly are you looking, boy? Look again.\u201d \n \u201cHuh? Kouenji is\u2026huh?\u201d \n Starting from the bottom of the page, Sudou scanned upward, and there he found Kouenji Rokosuke\u2019s name. Unbelievably, Kouenji had tied for the top spot, scoring ninety points. That meant he\u2019d been able to solve one of those super difficult problems. \n \u201cI never thought that Sudou was an idiot like me!\u201d cried Ike, a mixture of wonder and sarcasm in his voice. \n \u201cOh, one more thing. This school, which operates under government supervision, boasts a high rate of advancement into elite education and workforce placement. That is a well-known fact. It\u2019s very likely that most of you have chosen a college or future workplace.\u201d \n Well, naturally. This school boasted the highest rates of advancement in the whole country. There were rumors that it was possible to get into a highly competitive school or company just by graduating. Rumors even suggested that graduation from this school was like receiving a recommendation to Tokyo University, the most prestigious of Japan\u2019s institutes of higher learning. \n \u201cHowever, nothing comes easy in this world. Mediocre people such as yourselves would have to be naive to think that you could easily get into the college or workplace of your choice.\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei\u2019s words carried throughout the room. \n \u201cIn other words, you\u2019re saying that if we want to get into the company or college of our choice, we must, at minimum, surpass Class C?\u201d Hirata asked. \n \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. To make your dreams of a bright future come true, your only option is to overtake Class A. This school guarantees nothing for any other students.\u201d \n \u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026absurd! We didn\u2019t hear anything about that!\u201d \n A bespectacled student named Yukimura stood up. He\u2019d tied with Kouenji for the top score, indicating that there were no issues with his academic abilities. \n \u201cHow disgraceful. There\u2019s nothing more pitiful than men losing their cool.\u201d As if prompted by Yukimura\u2019s words, Kouenji let out a sigh. \n \u201cDon\u2019t you feel dissatisfied being in Class D, Kouenji?\u201d Yukimura asked. \n \u201cDissatisfied? Why would I feel dissatisfied? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d \n \u201cBecause the school says we\u2019re so low that we\u2019re basically delinquents and failures. We\u2019ve been told that there\u2019s no guarantee whatsoever that we\u2019ll advance into higher education or get a job!\u201d \n \u201cPah. Utter nonsense. That\u2019s so marvelously stupid that I can\u2019t even find the words.\u201d Kouenji didn\u2019t even stop polishing his nails or turn to face Yukimura as he spoke. \u201cThe school simply hasn\u2019t seen my potential yet. I pride myself on being great, and I value, respect, and regard myself more highly than anyone. So, the school arbitrarily placing me into Class D means nothing. Say, for instance, that I dropped out of school\u2014I would be perfectly fine. After all, I am 100 percent positive that the school would come crying to take me back.\u201d \n That certainly sounded like something Kouenji would say. Was it being macho? Or narcissism? It\u2019s true that if you didn\u2019t care about the school\u2019s classification of students, then it really wasn\u2019t a big deal. If you considered Kouenji\u2019s impressive intellect and physical ability, it was difficult to imagine that all of the students in Class A could be better than him. Perhaps he\u2019d been assigned to Class D because of his personality rather than his ability. \n \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t care in the slightest if the school does or doesn\u2019t assist me to higher education or the workforce. It\u2019s been decided that I will lead the Kouenji conglomerate group. Whether I\u2019m in Class D or Class A is a trivial matter.\u201d \n It was true that for a man whose future was already decided, getting into Class A was far from a necessity. Yukimura, at a loss for words, simply sat back down. \n \u201cIt looks like your bubbles have been burst. If you had simply understood the harsh reality of the situation from the start, then this long homeroom period might have meant something. Your midterm exams are in three weeks. Please think things over, and be careful not to drop out. I have confidence that you can find a way to avoid getting red marks on your report cards. If at all possible, challenge yourself to act in a way befitting a skilled individual.\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei exited the room, closing the door with some force for added emphasis. The students marked in red were left dejected. Even the normally proud Sudou clicked his tongue and hung his head in shame. \n "], "Chapter 65": ["==============="], "Chapter 66": ["7.1 \n \u201cI f we don\u2019t get any more points, what I am gonna do?\u201d \n \u201cI used up all of my points yesterday\u2026\u201d \n During the break, the classroom erupted into an uproar\u2026or rather, chaos. \n \u201cForget about the points. What the hell about this class ? Why was I put into Class D?!\u201d Yukimura cried resentfully. A thin layer of sweat covered his forehead. \n \u201cWait, does this mean that we can\u2019t get into college now? Why did we even go to this school? Does Sae-chan-sensei hate us or something?\u201d \n None of the other students could hide their confusion. \n \u201cI understand that you\u2019re all confused right now, but everyone needs to calm down.\u201d Hirata, sensing the classroom tipping toward crisis, stood and attempted to rein everyone in. \n \u201cHow are we supposed to calm down? Aren\u2019t you frustrated that she called us a bunch of failures?!\u201d Yukimura said. \n \u201cEven if I was, isn\u2019t it better for us to band together so we can turn things around?\u201d Hirata asked. \n \u201cTurn things around? I don\u2019t even agree with how we were sorted in the first place!\u201d \n \u201cI understand. However, sitting here whining won\u2019t help us right now.\u201d \n \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Yukimura quickly went to Hirata and forcefully grasped his collar. \n \u201cCalm down, you two, okay? I\u2019m sure that the teacher talked to us harshly so we\u2019d be inspired to do better, right?\u201d \n That was Kushida. She slipped between the two and separated them, gently taking Yukimura\u2019s balled fist. Just as anyone would expect, Yukimura didn\u2019t try to hurt her and reflexively took half a step back. \n \u201cBesides, it\u2019s only been one month since we started here, right? Like Hirata-kun said, it\u2019s better if we all do our best together. Do you think that I\u2019m wrong about that?\u201d \n \u201cN-no, it\u2019s\u2026 Well, I certainly wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re wrong , but\u2026\u201d \n Yukimura\u2019s anger had almost completely vanished. Kushida looked at everyone in class, and it was almost as if her eyes reflected a sincere wish for us to work together. \n \u201cYeah, it\u2019s better for us to band together. Right? There\u2019s no need for you to fight, Yukimura. Hirata.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I lost my cool,\u201d Yukimura said. \n \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I should have chosen my words a little more carefully.\u201d \n Kushida Kikyou\u2019s presence brought everyone together. I took out my cell phone and snapped a picture of the paper with the class point totals. Horikita, taking notice, looked at me with a puzzled expression. \n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to figure out how points are calculated yet. You\u2019ve also been taking notes, haven\u2019t you?\u201d \n If I could figure out how many points were deducted by being late or talking in class, it\u2019d be easier to come up with countermeasures. \n \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be difficult to figure out those details at this stage? Besides, I don\u2019t think you can resolve this simply by investigating. Everyone in our class arrived late and talked too often.\u201d \n As Horikita had said, it certainly was difficult to conclude anything based on the current information. Also, Horikita\u2019s usually cool, composed attitude was gone. She seemed rather impatient. \n \u201cAre you trying to get into college, too?\u201d I wondered. \n \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d \n \u201cWell, when we learned about the differences between A and D, you looked shocked.\u201d \n \u201cBut so was almost everyone in this class, more or less. If they\u2019d told us at the start, that would\u2019ve been one thing, but to explain it at this stage? Unthinkable.\u201d \n Well, she was right about that. There was probably a lot of discontented grumbling coming from Class C and B students as well. After all, the school treated every class except for A like leftovers. Trying to get to the top was probably our best option. \n \u201cI think that before we even start talking about A or D or whatever, we should secure points.\u201d \n \u201cPoints are just a byproduct of our performance, though. Not having points won\u2019t hinder our lives here at school. We have free options at almost every turn, right?\u201d Horikita said. \n If you thought about it that way, it\u2019d be a relief for the students who\u2019d lost all of their points. \n \u201c\u2018Won\u2019t hinder our lives here at school,\u2019 huh?\u201d \n If you wanted to simply get by, this wouldn\u2019t be a problem. However, there were many things you could only obtain with points. Entertainment, for example. If the lack of entertainment options wasn\u2019t a problem, then it\u2019d be fine, but\u2026 \n \u201cAbout how many points did you spend last month, Ayanokouji-kun?\u201d \n \u201cHm? Oh, my points? I spent about 20,000, approximately.\u201d \n This was tragic for the students who\u2019d used up their points. Like Yamauchi, who was ranting and raving at his desk. Ike had also spent almost all of his points. \n \u201cWhile unfortunate, they\u2019ve simply reaped what they\u2019ve sown,\u201d Horikita said. \n It was certainly true that indiscriminately spending all 100,000 points in a single month was a slight problem. \n \u201cThey baited us into spending all our points over the course of this one month, and we fell for it.\u201d \n One hundred thousand points per month. Even though everyone had thought it too good to be true, we\u2019d been too happy to care. \n \u201cAttention, everyone. Before class begins, I want you to listen seriously for a moment. Especially you, Sudou-kun.\u201d The class was still in an uproar, but Hirata claimed everyone\u2019s attention when he stood at the teacher\u2019s podium. \n \u201cTch, what is it?\u201d Sudou grumbled. \n \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any points this month. This is a serious problem, and one that will have an enormous impact on our daily lives moving forward. It\u2019s impossible for us to make it to graduation with zero points, right?\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right!\u201d shouted one of the female students, her voice full of despair. \n Hirata gave a kind nod in response, sympathizing with her. \n \u201cOf course. Therefore, we must earn points next month. To do that, we all need to cooperate with each other. So, please, take care not to be late to class or to talk during the lecture. Also, the use of cell phones during class is prohibited, of course.\u201d \n \u201cHuh? And why do you get to tell us what to do? Besides, that\u2019s supposing our points will increase. If they don\u2019t change at all, then it\u2019s useless.\u201d \n \u201cAs long as we continue talking during class and being late, our points won\u2019t increase for sure. Although we can\u2019t go below zero points, disruption will, without a doubt, count as strikes against us.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m still not convinced. Besides, even if we get serious and work hard in class, our points won\u2019t necessarily go up.\u201d Sudou snorted and crossed his arms in defiance. Kushida took notice of this and commented on it. \n \u201cWell, the teacher did say that the being late and talking in class were obviously bad, right?\u201d \n \u201cYeah, I agree with Kushida-san. It\u2019s only natural to avoid doing those things.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s just your own selfish interpretation. Besides, you don\u2019t know how to increase our points. Try talking to me after you figure that out.\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything particularly wrong with what you said, Sudou-kun. I apologize if I made you feel uncomfortable.\u201d Hirata bowed his head politely toward the disgruntled Sudou. \u201cHowever, Sudou-kun, it\u2019s a fact that unless we all cooperate, we won\u2019t get any more points.\u201d \n \u201cDo whatever you want. It doesn\u2019t matter. Just don\u2019t involve me in it. Understand?\u201d Sudou snapped. \n As if being in the room made him feel uncomfortable, he left immediately. I had to wonder: Would he return when class started? Or did he not intend to return at all? \n \u201cSudou-kun really can\u2019t read the room. He\u2019s the one who was late to class the most. Couldn\u2019t we still get some points even without Sudou-kun?\u201d \n \u201cYeah. He really is the worst. Why is he in our class?\u201d \n Hmm. Until now, everyone had been enjoying their lives of luxury to the absolute fullest. No one had previously complained about Sudou. Hirata stepped down from the podium and, strangely, stopped right in front of my desk. \n \u201cHorikita-san, Ayanokouji-kun, do you have a moment? I want to speak with you about how we can increase our points. I\u2019d like you to join me. Can you?\u201d \n \u201cWhy do you want us?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cI want to hear everyone\u2019s voices. However, if I ask for everyone to weigh in, I think more than half of the class probably won\u2019t take it seriously.\u201d \n So, he wanted to ask us individually? I doubted I\u2019d be able to come up with any particularly useful ideas, but I supposed it couldn\u2019t hurt to talk. Just as I was thinking that\u2026 \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, can you ask someone else? I\u2019m not particularly good at discussing things with others,\u201d said Horikita. \n \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t force you to speak up. If you could help think of something, that would be good. Simply being there would be enough,\u201d Hirata said. \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have no interest in something meaningless.\u201d \n \u201cThis is the first trial we\u2019re facing together as a united Class D. So then\u2014\u201d \n \u201cI refuse. I won\u2019t participate.\u201d Her words were stern, yet composed. While she\u2019d considered Hirata\u2019s position, she refused him once again. \n \u201cI\u2026I see. I\u2019m sorry. If you change your mind, I\u2019d love for you to join us.\u201d \n Horikita had already stopped looking at Hirata, who withdrew dejectedly. \n \u201cWhat about you, Ayanokouji-kun?\u201d he asked. \n Honestly, I\u2019d be glad to participate. I\u2019d thought that most of the class would be involved. However, if Horikita was the only one absent, then she might be treated the same as Sudou. \n \u201cAh\u2026I\u2019ll pass. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry for bothering you. If you change your mind, please let me know.\u201d \n Hirata probably understood what I was thinking. I hadn\u2019t rejected him strongly. After the discussion ended, Horikita began preparing for the next class. \n \u201cHirata\u2019s a great guy. He\u2019s able to get everyone to take action just like that. People can easily get depressed in these situations.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s one perspective, yes. If we could easily solve this by talking, then that\u2019d be fine. However, if an unintelligent student tries to lead the discussion, the group will fall further into chaos, to the point where there\u2019s no hope of salvaging anything. Besides, I can\u2019t meekly accept my current situation.\u201d \n \u201cYou can\u2019t accept what now? What do you mean?\u201d \n Horikita didn\u2019t answer my question. She fell completely silent. \n "], "Chapter 67": ["==============="], "Chapter 68": ["7.2 \n C lass had ended for the day. Hirata stood at the podium, using the blackboard to prepare for our big discussion. Because of Hirata\u2019s powerful charisma, almost everyone in our class had shown, with the exception of a few like Horikita and Sudou. When I looked around, I noticed that they\u2019d already left the room. I decided to leave before the discussion got into full swing, as well. \n \u201cAyanokouji!\u201d \n Yamauchi suddenly appeared from under my desk, his expression deathlike. \n \u201cWhoa! Wh-what? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d \n \u201cHey, buy this from me for 20,000 points. I can\u2019t buy anything!\u201d he cried. \n Yamauchi placed the game console he\u2019d purchased the other day on my desk. Frankly, I didn\u2019t even want the thing. \n \u201cBut if you sell that to me, who am I supposed to play with?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cHow the heck should I know? Come on, it\u2019s good, right? It\u2019s special, so it\u2019s a good deal.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019ll buy it from you for 1,000 points.\u201d \n \u201cAyanokouji! Come on, you\u2019re my only hope!\u201d \n \u201cWhy am I the only one? I can\u2019t afford it, anyway.\u201d \n Yamauchi looked at me all teary-eyed, which grossed me out. I looked the other way. He must have realized I wasn\u2019t biting, so he immediately switched to a new target. \n \u201cProfessor! Your best buddy has a favor to ask! Buy this game system for 22,000 points!\u201d \n He was trying to get the Professor to buy it and had shamelessly increased the price. \n \u201cThings must be really tough for the people who used up their points,\u201d remarked Kushida as she observed Yamauchi. \n \u201cWhat about you, Kushida? Do you have enough points? Girls have a lot of necessities, after all.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m okay. For now, anyway. I\u2019ve used up about half of my points. I kind of lost control the first month and overspent, so it\u2019ll be a little difficult to hold myself back. What about you, Ayanokouji-kun? Are you okay?\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s got to be hard not to spend money when you\u2019re so popular. I\u2019ve barely used any of my points, to be honest. I haven\u2019t really needed to buy anything.\u201d \n \u201cBecause you don\u2019t have friends?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cHey\u2026\u201d \n \u201cAh, sorry, sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to offend,\u201d Kushida apologized with a giggle. She was too cute when she did that. \n \u201cHey, Kushida-san, do you have a minute?\u201d Karuizawa asked. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Karuizawa-san?\u201d \n \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve spent way too many points, and I\u2019m seriously running low. Some of the other girls in class have lent me a few points, but I was wondering if you could help me out, too. We\u2019re friends, right? I only need, like, 2,000 points from you.\u201d \n Karuizawa didn\u2019t seem all that earnest, laughing breezily while she hit up Kushida. In such a case, rejection should be the knee-jerk reaction. \n \u201cOkay, sure.\u201d \n Sure?! I repeated silently, but it wasn\u2019t my business. This was a problem for the friends in question. Kushida had decided to help Karuizawa without even a hint of reluctance. \n \u201cThank you! This is really what friends are for, huh? By the way, here\u2019s my number. Okay, see you later. Ah, Inogashira-san! Hey, to tell you the truth, I used up too many of my points\u2026\u201d \n Karuizawa turned away just like that and went in pursuit of her next target. \n \u201cAre you sure? You know you probably won\u2019t get those points back, right?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cI can\u2019t just ignore a friend in need. Karuizawa-san has a lot of friends, too, so I think it\u2019s probably hard for her not to have any points.\u201d \n \u201cI think using up 100,000 points is kind of her own fault, though.\u201d \n \u201cWait, how do you transfer points?\u201d Kushida asked. \n \u201cKaruizawa gave you her phone number, didn\u2019t she? You should be able to do it with your cell phone.\u201d \n \u201cThis school really does take great care of its students. It even has a way to help students like Karuizawa-san.\u201d \n True, transferring points was a lifesaver for Karuizawa, but was it really necessary to give her the money? If anything, it seemed a recipe for disaster. \n The loudspeaker came alive with a soothing sound effect, and a robotic voice issued an announcement. \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun, from first-year Class D. Please come see Chiyabashira-sensei in the faculty office.\u201d \n \u201cLooks like the teacher wants to see you.\u201d \n \u201cYeah\u2026 Sorry, Kushida. Gotta go.\u201d \n I was sure I hadn\u2019t done anything to get me called to the office. Exiting the classroom, I could feel my classmates\u2019 stares drilling a hole into the back of my head. Timid as a rabbit, I found the faculty office and entered. I looked all around, but I didn\u2019t find Chiyabashira-sensei anywhere. Baffled, I called out to a teacher inspecting her appearance in a mirror. \n \u201cExcuse me, is Chiyabashira-sensei here?\u201d \n \u201cHmm? Sae-chan? Oh, she was just here a moment ago.\u201d \n The teacher had wavy, shoulder-length hair, which made her look mature. The way she said Chiyabashira-sensei\u2019s name made them sound close. They were near in age and probably friends. \n \u201cShe must have stepped away for a minute. Do you want to wait here?\u201d \n \u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019ll wait in the hall.\u201d \n I didn\u2019t like being in the faculty office. I hated attention, so the hall would do just as well. However, the young teacher unexpectedly followed me. \n \u201cI\u2019m Hoshinomiya Chie, in charge of Class B. Sae and I have been best friends since high school. That\u2019s why we call each other Sae-chan and Chie-chan.\u201d \n That information seemed kind of superfluous. \n \u201cHey, why did Sae-chan call you? Huh? Huh? Why?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cNo idea.\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t understand. You were called to the office without a reason? Hmm? What\u2019s your name?\u201d \n An onslaught of questions. She scanned me from top to bottom, as if sizing me up. \n \u201cMy name\u2019s Ayanokouji,\u201d I said. \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun, huh? Oh, wow, that\u2019s a cool name. You\u2019re pretty popular, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n What was with this overly friendly teacher? She acted more like a student. If this were an all-boy school, she would have immediately captured every student\u2019s heart. \n \u201cHey, do you already have a girlfriend?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cNo\u2026 I\u2019m, uh, not especially popular.\u201d \n I tried to seem reluctant, but Hoshinomiya-sensei kept pushing herself onto me. She grabbed my arms with slender, delicate hands. \n \u201cHmm? How unexpected. If we were in the same class, I\u2019d never leave you alone. Perhaps because you\u2019re so innocent? Or do you like playing hard to get?\u201d \n She caressed my cheeks. I had no idea what to do. She\u2019d probably stop if I licked her fingers, but I had a feeling that\u2019d get me expelled. \n \u201cWhat are you doing, Hoshinomiya?\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei appeared out of nowhere. With a loud thud , she smacked Hoshinomiya-sensei on the head with her clipboard. Hoshinomiya-sensei crouched and gripped her skull in apparent pain. \n \u201cOuch! What was that for?\u201d she cried. \n \u201cFor getting involved with one of my students.\u201d \n \u201cI was only keeping him company while he waited for you, Sae-chan.\u201d \n \u201cIt would have been better if you just left him alone. Thanks for waiting, Ayanokouji. Let\u2019s go into the office.\u201d \n \u201cThe guidance office?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid I do something wrong? I\u2019ve been trying to keep a low profile here.\u201d \n \u201cA good answer. Come.\u201d \n While I wondered what this was all about, I followed Chiyabashira-sensei. Hoshinomiya-sensei remained by my side, smiling widely. Chiyabashira-sensei noticed and turned, her face much like a demon\u2019s. \n \u201cYou stay,\u201d she ordered. \n \u201cCome on, don\u2019t be so cold! It won\u2019t be the end of the world if I listen, right? Besides Sae-chan, you\u2019re definitely not the type to give one-on-one guidance. Pulling a new student like Ayanokouji-kun into the guidance room out of nowhere\u2026 Are you after something, I wonder?\u201d \n Grinning, Hoshinomiya-sensei scooted behind me and placed her hands on my shoulders. I sensed a storm brewing. \n \u201cSo, Sae-chan, are you looking to be dominated by a younger man?\u201d \n Dominated by a younger man? What did that mean? \n \u201cDon\u2019t say such stupid things. That wouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d \n \u201cHee, you\u2019re certainly right. It wouldn\u2019t be possible for you , Sae-chan,\u201d Hoshinomiya-sensei muttered, her words laced with a double meaning. \n \u201cWhy are you following us? This is a Class D matter.\u201d \n \u201cHuh? I can\u2019t go to the guidance room? That\u2019s not okay? Come on, I can give advice, too.\u201d \n As Hoshinomiya-sensei continued to follow, a female student came up to us, a beautiful girl with light-pink hair. I\u2019d never seen her before. \n \u201cHoshinomiya-sensei, do you have a moment? The student council wishes to discuss something with you.\u201d She glanced at me, but quickly returned her attention to Hoshinomiya-sensei. \n \u201cAll right, you have someone who needs you. Get to it.\u201d Slap! Chiyabashira-sensei smacked Hoshinomiya-sensei on the butt with her clipboard. \n \u201cAw! She\u2019ll get mad at me if I hang around any longer. See you later, Ayanokouji-kun! All right, Ichinose-san. Let\u2019s go to the faculty office.\u201d \n With that, she turned on her heel and left with the beautiful Ichinose. \n Chiyabashira-sensei lightly scratched her head while she watched Hoshinomiya-sensei leave. Soon after, we entered the guidance room, which stood beside the faculty office. \n \u201cSo. Why did you call me here?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cWell, about that\u2026 Before we begin, please come here.\u201d \n She briefly glanced at a clock hanging on the wall, which gave the time as nine o\u2019clock, and opened the door. Inside was a small office kitchenette. She placed a kettle on top of a stove. \n \u201cI\u2019m going to make tea. Is roasted green okay?\u201d she asked. \n I picked up the container with the tea powder. \n \u201cDon\u2019t make any unnecessary moves. Shut up and get in here. Understand? Don\u2019t make a sound and stay until I tell you it\u2019s okay to come out. If you don\u2019t do as I say, you\u2019ll be expelled,\u201d she said. \n \u201cHuh? What do you mean by\u2014\u201d \n She closed the door to the kitchenette without explanation, leaving me in there. What in the world was she scheming? I did as I was told and waited. Soon after, I heard the outer door to the guidance room open. \n \u201cAh, come in. So, what did you want to talk to me about, Horikita?\u201d I heard Chiyabashira-sensei say. \n Apparently Horikita was in need of guidance. \n \u201cI will be frank. Why was I sorted into Class D?\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s quite frank.\u201d \n \u201cToday, you told us that the school sorted superior students into Class A. You said that Class D was filled with the leftovers, the last bastion of delinquents.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s true. You must consider yourself to be a superior person.\u201d \n I wondered how Horikita would respond. I\u2019d bet she\u2019d confidently object. \n \u201cI solved nearly every problem on the entrance examination. I made no substantial mistakes on the interview, either. At the very least, I shouldn\u2019t have been sorted into Class D.\u201d \n Looks like I would have won that bet. Horikita was definitely the type to think herself superior. She wasn\u2019t excessively self-conscious, either. She\u2019d tied for first place on the test, as shown in the morning\u2019s results. \n \u201cYou solved nearly all of the problems on the entrance examination, hmm? Normally I couldn\u2019t show the examination results to individual students, but I\u2019ll make an exception in this case. I just so happen to have your answer sheet here.\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re incredibly prepared. It\u2019s\u2026almost as if you knew I\u2019d come here to protest.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m an instructor. I understand the mind of a student, at least to some degree, Horikita Suzune. Just as you said, you did well on the entrance examination. You had the third-highest test score among the first-year students and were close to the highest- and second-highest-scoring students. You did exceedingly well. And you\u2019re right: We found no particular problems in your interview. On the contrary, we evaluated you quite highly.\u201d \n \u201cThank you very much. So then\u2026why?\u201d \n \u201cBefore I answer, why are you dissatisfied with Class D?\u201d \n \u201cWho could be happy with an incorrect evaluation? Furthermore, the class rankings greatly impact our future prospects. Of course I\u2019m dissatisfied.\u201d \n \u201cIncorrect evaluation? Perhaps your self-evaluation is far too high.\u201d Chiyabashira-sensei snickered, or rather, laughed outright. \u201cI acknowledge that your academic ability is excellent. You\u2019re certainly very smart. However, who decided that smart people are categorically superior? We never said that.\u201d \n \u201cBut\u2026that\u2019s just common sense.\u201d \n \u201cCommon sense? Didn\u2019t common sense create our current, flawed society? Before, Japan relied solely on test scores to separate the superior and inferior. As a result, the incompetents at the top tried desperately to kick down the truly superior students. In the end, we settled on a system of hereditary succession.\u201d \n A system of hereditary succession meant that things like social standing, prestige, and employment were passed down to future generations. At those words, I groaned unintentionally. My chest hurt. \n \u201cYou\u2019re a capable student. I don\u2019t deny that. However, this school\u2019s goal is to produce superior people. If you believe academics alone place you into a higher class, you are mistaken. That was the very first thing we explained to you. Besides, think rationally. Would we have admitted someone like Sudou if we decided superiority based solely on academic merit?\u201d \n \u201cTch\u2026\u201d \n Despite the fact that this was one of the country\u2019s leading preparatory schools, this place allowed students to enroll for purposes other than academics. \n \u201cFurthermore, you may be too hasty in proclaiming that no one would be happy to be incorrectly evaluated. Take Class A, for instance. They are under incredible pressure from the school, and also the target of extreme envy from the lower classes. Competing every day with that kind of pressure bearing down upon you is far more difficult than you might imagine. There are some students who are happy to be incorrectly evaluated at a lower level.\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? I can\u2019t understand such a person.\u201d \n \u201cIs that so? I think that Class D boasts some of those people. Strange students who would happily be set at a low level.\u201d \n It was almost as if she were talking to me. \n \u201cYou still haven\u2019t given me an explanation. Was I honestly sorted into Class D? Did anything go wrong with the grading? Please double-check,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you weren\u2019t sorted by mistake. You are definitely in Class D. You are at that level.\u201d \n \u201cIs that so? Then I will ask the school again, at another time.\u201d \n Apparently, she wasn\u2019t going to give up. Horikita had merely determined that her homeroom teacher was the wrong person to ask. \n \u201cYou\u2019ll get the same answer from anyone in a higher position. Besides, there\u2019s no need to be disappointed. As I told you this morning, it\u2019s possible for one class to overtake another. You could conceivably reach Class A before you graduate.\u201d \n \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it will be easy, though. Forget overtaking Class A; how in the world could those immature Class D misfits gain more points? I can\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible.\u201d Horikita spoke the truth. The difference in points was overwhelming. \n \u201cI don\u2019t know. You alone get to decide how you head down that path. At any rate, Horikita, do you need to be in Class A for any special reason?\u201d \n \u201cWell\u2026I suppose that\u2019s enough for now. Excuse me. But know that I\u2019m not yet convinced I was sorted correctly.\u201d \n \u201cUnderstood. I will keep that in mind.\u201d \n A chair squeaked against the floor, signaling that the discussion was over. \n \u201cOh, that reminds me. I\u2019ve summoned another person to the guidance room. It\u2019s someone relevant to you.\u201d \n \u201cRelevant to me? No, you can\u2019t mean\u2026 bro\u2014\u201d \n \u201cCome on out, Ayanokouji,\u201d the teacher said. \n This was a bad time to reveal myself. Maybe I just wouldn\u2019t go. \n \u201cIf you don\u2019t come out, I\u2019ll have you expelled.\u201d \n Jeez. A teacher shouldn\u2019t casually wield expulsion like a weapon. \n \u201cHow long do you intend to keep me waiting?\u201d \n With a sigh, I entered the room. Naturally, Horikita appeared surprised and perplexed. \n \u201cWere you listening to our conversation?\u201d she asked me. \n \u201cListening? I know you guys were talking, but I didn\u2019t really hear anything. The walls are surprisingly thick.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s not true. Voices carry pretty well into the kitchen.\u201d Apparently, Chiyabashira-sensei wanted to drag me into the action. \n \u201cSensei, why would you do this?\u201d Horikita noticed that this had all been planned and was clearly angry. \n \u201cBecause I deemed it necessary. Now then, Ayanokouji, I\u2019ll explain why I called you here.\u201d Chiyabashira-sensei dismissed Horikita\u2019s concerns and shifted her attention to me. \n \u201cWell then, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026\u201d Horikita muttered. \n \u201cWait, Horikita. It would be in your best interest to stay and listen. It may provide you with a hint on how to reach Class A.\u201d \n Horikita stopped dead in her tracks and sat back down. \n \u201cPlease keep it brief,\u201d she said. \n Chiyabashira-sensei chuckled as she glanced over her clipboard. \u201cYou\u2019re an interesting student, Ayanokouji.\u201d \n \u201cNot at all. I\u2019m certainly not as interesting as a teacher with a strange surname like Chiyabashira.\u201d \n \u201cWould you speak like that to every Chiyabashira in the nation? Hmm?\u201d \n If you looked all over the country for another person with the surname of Chiyabashira, you probably wouldn\u2019t find one. \n \u201cWell, when I read over the entrance exam\u2019s results, your scores piqued my interest. I was shocked.\u201d \n On her clipboard, I saw a rather familiar answer sheet. \n \u201cFifty points in Japanese. Fifty points in mathematics. Fifty points in English. Fifty points in social studies. Fifty points in science. You even scored Fifty points on the recent short test. Do you know what this means?\u201d \n A stunned Horikita looked over my test paper and then shifted her focus to me. \u201cThis is a rather frightening coincidence,\u201d she said. \n \u201cOh? You believe that getting 50s all across the board was a coincidence? He did it intentionally.\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s a coincidence. There\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s not. Besides, what would I gain by manipulating my scores in the first place? If I were intelligent enough to achieve high marks, I would\u2019ve tried to get perfect scores.\u201d \n As I feigned innocence, Chiyabashira-sensei sighed in exasperation. \n \u201cYou really do seem like an odious student. Listen. Only 3 percent of students solved the fifth math problem successfully. However, you solved it perfectly, and used a complex formula to do so. However, the tenth problem on the test had a completion rate of 76 percent. Did you make a mistake on it? Is that normal?\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t know what normal is. It was a coincidence, I tell you. A coincidence.\u201d \n \u201cFor crying out loud! I respect your frank attitude, but it\u2019ll cause problems for you in the future,\u201d the teacher said. \n \u201cI\u2019ll think about that when the time comes.\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei shot Horikita a glance that seemed to say, What do you think? \n \u201cWhy do you pretend not to know?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cLike I said, it was a coincidence. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m hiding that I\u2019m a genius or anything.\u201d \n \u201cI wonder. He may be even more intelligent than you , Horikita.\u201d \n Horikita flinched. Please don\u2019t say anything unnecessary, Chiyabashira-sensei. \n \u201cI don\u2019t like studying, and I don\u2019t plan to try hard. That\u2019s why I get those scores.\u201d \n \u201cA student who chose this school wouldn\u2019t say something like that. However, some students may have different reasons for getting in. You, for example, and Kouenji as well. I think you\u2019re fine with being in either D or A.\u201d \n This school wasn\u2019t the only abnormal thing. The teachers were weird, too. Moments earlier, Chiyabashira-sensei had upset Horikita with just her words. It was almost as if the teachers knew every student\u2019s secrets. \n \u201cWhat other reasons do you have?\u201d Horikita asked. \n \u201cYou want me to explain it to you in detail?\u201d \n I noticed the sharp gleam in Chiyabashira-sensei\u2019s eyes. It was almost as if she wanted to provoke Horikita. \n \u201cNo, we\u2019d best stop here. Any more, and I might go mad and destroy all the furniture in here,\u201d I said. \n \u201cIf you did that, Ayanokouji, I would demote you to E Class.\u201d \n \u201cWait, there\u2019s an E Class?\u201d \n \u201cCertainly. Of course, the \u2018E\u2019 stands for \u2018expelled.\u2019 As in, you\u2019d be kicked out of school. Well, I suppose our conversation has ended. Enjoy your lives.\u201d \n What incredible sarcasm. \n \u201cI\u2019m leaving, too. It\u2019s almost time for the faculty meeting. I\u2019m going to close the door, so please step outside.\u201d \n She pushed us into the hallway. Why had Chiyabashira-sensei called both of us in together? She didn\u2019t seem like the type to do meaningless things. \n \u201cWell. Should we head back?\u201d I asked. \n Horikita didn\u2019t respond, and I walked away. Probably best if we weren\u2019t together right now. \n \u201cWait.\u201d Horikita called out, but I didn\u2019t stop. If I managed to keep away from her until I got to the dorms, I\u2019d be home free. \n \u201cWas your score\u2026really just a coincidence?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cI already said so, didn\u2019t I? Or do you have any proof that I got that score on purpose?\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t, but\u2026I also don\u2019t understand, Ayanokouji-kun. You said that you like to avoid trouble, but you don\u2019t seem to be interested in Class A.\u201d \n \u201cYou have an extraordinary fixation on Class A.\u201d \n \u201cShould I not? I\u2019m simply striving to improve my future prospects.\u201d \n \u201cOh, absolutely. You should. It\u2019s perfectly natural.\u201d \n \u201cWhen I entered this school, I thought graduation was my only goal. But the reality is different. I\u2019m not even at the starting line.\u201d \n Horikita sped up and started walking next to me. \n \u201cSo, why are you aiming for Class A?\u201d \n \u201cFirst, I want to ascertain this school\u2019s true motives. Why was I put into Class D? Chiyabashira-sensei said I\u2019d been deemed a Class D student, but why? When I discover the answer, I\u2019ll aim for A. No, I will definitely make it to A.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s going to be difficult. You\u2019ll have to rehabilitate the problem children. You have Sudou\u2019s continued tardiness and class cutting, everyone else talking in class, and, of course, the test scores. Even if you manage all of that, you\u2019re still at zero points.\u201d \n \u201cI know that. I still think the school made a mistake with my placement.\u201d \n Anxiety had replaced Horikita\u2019s previously overflowing confidence. Did she really know that was the case? The only conclusion I could draw from today was that \u201cdespair\u201d was a two-syllable word. If you followed the fundamental school rules, you could avoid losing points. However, it was still unclear how to turn those losses into gains. Class A had had only had a small number of points subtracted. \n Even if we somehow found an efficient way to increase our points, the other classes might also find a way to do the same. Since we\u2019d started out with such a substantial difference in points, we\u2019d have to compete hard against the other classes in a limited amount of time. \n \u201cI can understand your thoughts, but I don\u2019t think the school will continue supervising us so carefully. If they did, there\u2019d be no meaning in competition,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cI see. I suppose you could think that. So, you\u2019ll try to take care of this situation by yourself?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cYes.\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t act so proud.\u201d \n A hand chopped my side. Horikita ignored my pained expression. \n \u201cOw. Look, I understand how you feel, but you can\u2019t solve this by yourself. Think about Sudou. Even if you improve, the rest of the class will drag you down.\u201d \n \u201cNo. You\u2019re right that no lone individual can solve this problem. We won\u2019t even make it to the starting line without everyone\u2019s help.\u201d \n \u201cWell, it sounds like we\u2019ve got a huge problem on our hands.\u201d \n \u201cWe have three major, immediate issues. Tardiness and talking during class are the first two. Third, we must make sure no one fails the midterm exam.\u201d \n \u201cI think we\u2019ll manage those first two issues, but the midterms\u2026\u201d \n The short test we\u2019d taken had contained a few difficult questions, but overall it had been pretty easy. Even at that level, some students had failed. Honestly, their chances of passing the midterm exam were slim. \n \u201cI need your help, Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d \n \u201cHelp?\u201d \n Horikita glared at me. \n \u201cWhat if I refuse? Like how you refused Hirata this morning.\u201d \n \u201cDo you want to refuse?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cWhat if I said I\u2019d gladly help?\u201d \n \u201cI never would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d do it gladly, but I doubt you\u2019d refuse. If you did refuse to work with me, then that would be the end of it. No matter what I said about our future, I\u2019d be powerless if you refused. So, will you help me or not?\u201d \n I wanted to say what she\u2019d said before, when she\u2019d silenced Hirata\u2026 What was it, again? Well, it wasn\u2019t as though I would just bluntly refuse someone who asked for my help. Then again, if I told her I would help, she\u2019d probably run me into the ground until graduation. I needed the heart of a demon. \n \u201cI refuse,\u201d I said. \n \u201cI always knew you\u2019d help, Ayanokouji-kun. I\u2019m grateful.\u201d \n \u201cI didn\u2019t say that! I turned you down!\u201d \n \u201cNo, I heard the voice inside your head. You said you\u2019d help.\u201d \n Terrifying! It was like she could read my thoughts. \n \u201cI don\u2019t even know how I could help you, though.\u201d Besides being an exemplary student, Horikita was incredibly quick-witted. She probably didn\u2019t need my skills. \n \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t require your brain power, Ayanokouji-kun. Leave the planning to me, and act as I tell you.\u201d \n \u201cHuh? What do you mean by act?\u201d \n \u201cDoesn\u2019t our lack of points trouble you, Ayanokouji-kun? If you follow my instructions, I promise you we\u2019ll see a point increase. I would never lie.\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re cooking up, but there are other people you could count on. If you made friends, they\u2019d cooperate with you.\u201d \n \u201cUnfortunately, no one else in Class D is nearly as easy to manipulate as you.\u201d \n \u201cNo, there are several people. Hirata, for example. He\u2019s popular and smart, so he\u2019d be perfect. Besides, he\u2019s worried that you\u2019re all alone, Horikita.\u201d \n If she reached out to him, they\u2019d probably become good friends. \n \u201cHe\u2019s no good. Even if he has some talent and ability, I can\u2019t use him. To use an analogy, think about the pieces in shogi. Right now, I don\u2019t need a gold or silver general. I want a pawn.\u201d \n So, you just called me a pawn? That\u2019s what you called me? \n \u201cSo, if a pawn were to cooperate, he could become a gold general?\u201d \n \u201cAn interesting answer, but you don\u2019t seem like the type to make that effort, Ayanokouji-kun. Besides, haven\u2019t you been thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve always been a pawn, I don\u2019t want to advance,\u2019 all along?\u201d \n She\u2019d shot me down with precisely the right brand of ammunition. If I were a normal person, my feelings would\u2019ve been hurt. \n \u201cSorry, but I can\u2019t help you. I\u2019m not suitable for this,\u201d I said. \n \u201cWell, contact me once you\u2019ve given it some thought. I look forward to hearing from you.\u201d \n Horikita wasn\u2019t paying attention to what I\u2019d said in the slightest. \n "], "Chapter 69": ["==============="], "Chapter 70": ["Chapter 8: The Association of Failures \n M ay 1 came and went, and before we knew it, the school week was over. Ike and the others had started listening to the teacher. Only Sudou kept unashamedly falling asleep in class, but no one tried to reprimand him. Because we hadn\u2019t yet found a method to increase our points, he\u2019d apparently decided not to fix his habits. However, many of our classmates grew to disdain him. \n I was a little sleepy, myself. It was hard to stay awake just before lunchtime. Also, I\u2019d stayed up late last night watching an online video. Ah, sleep would feel so nice\u2026 \n \u201cAh?!\u201d \n Just as my head started to bob, sudden pain shot through my right arm. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Ayanokouji? You cried out. Have you started your rebellious phase or something?\u201d \n \u201cN-no. Sorry, Chiyabashira-sensei. I got some dirt in my eye.\u201d \n Normally, the other students would have started whispering. But, wary of potentially losing points, they instead shot me pained glances. As I rubbed the sting on my arm, I glared at my neighbor. Horikita brandished her mathematical compass. This was insane. Why did she even have a compass ready in the first place? You didn\u2019t even really need one of those for this school. After class, I immediately went over to her. \n \u201cCertain things are off limits! It\u2019s dangerous to stab someone!\u201d \n \u201cAre you angry with me?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cYou put a hole in my arm! A hole!\u201d \n \u201cWhat? When did I stab with you a compass needle, Ayanokouji-kun?\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re holding a dangerous weapon right now.\u201d \n \u201cSo, just because I\u2019m holding something means I stabbed you?\u201d \n I\u2019d spent most of the class wide-eyed, not because of the lecture, but the pain. \n \u201cBe careful. If you get caught sleeping, that would undoubtedly lead to a loss in points.\u201d \n Horikita had started to take action within Class D. Her protests to the school had gone nowhere. Ah, that hurt! Damn it, if Horikita ever fell asleep in class, I\u2019d return the favor. When everyone got up for lunch, Hirata spoke. \n \u201cChiyabashira-sensei mentioned that the midterm is coming up soon. Remember that if you fail, you\u2019ll be expelled. Therefore, I think it would be a good idea to form a study group.\u201d \n Apparently, the hero of Class D had started another project. \n \u201cIf you neglect your studies, you\u2019ll get a failing grade and be expelled on the spot. I want to avoid that. However, studying won\u2019t just prevent expulsion; it may also help earn points. If we receive high marks, our class\u2019s assessment should improve as a result. I asked some of the students who scored high on the test to help prepare a study plan. So, I would like people who are anxious to come join our group. Everyone is welcome, of course.\u201d \n Hirata stared directly at Sudou while making his grand speech. \n \u201cTch.\u201d \n Sudou averted his gaze, crossed his arms, and closed his eyes. Ever since Sudou had stomped all over Hirata\u2019s introduction game, their relationship had been rocky. \n \u201cStarting today at five o\u2019clock, we will plan to study in this classroom for two hours a day until the test. If you\u2019d like to join us, please come whenever you like. Of course, I don\u2019t mind if you need to leave partway. That\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d \n Immediately after he\u2019d finished speaking, several of the failing students got up and went over. There were three people with failing grades who didn\u2019t rush to Hirata, though: Sudou, Ike, and Yamauchi. Ike and Yamauchi seemed unsure of what to do for a moment, but in the end, they stayed in their seats. I couldn\u2019t tell whether they were afraid Sudou might lose his temper, or because they were jealous of Hirata\u2019s popularity. \n "], "Chapter 71": ["==============="], "Chapter 72": ["8.1 \n \u201cA re you free for lunch? Do you want to eat together?\u201d \n During our break, Horikita came up and invited me out. \n \u201cIt\u2019s unusual to get an invitation from you. I feel nervous.\u201d \n \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be. I can treat you to the vegetable meal set, if that\u2019s okay with you.\u201d \n Wait, wasn\u2019t that the free meal? \n \u201cI\u2019m joking. Seriously, whatever you want to eat is on me.\u201d \n \u201cNow I\u2019m definitely scared. Is there some kind of catch?\u201d \n An invitation from Horikita was suspicious enough. The suddenness of the request also gave me pause. \n \u201cIf people can\u2019t honestly accept kindness, then mankind will meet its end, won\u2019t it?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cWell, I suppose so, but\u2026\u201d \n With no other plans, I decided to follow Horikita to the cafeteria, where I chose one of the most expensive special meal sets. Together, we sat down. \n \u201cWell then, shall we eat?\u201d she asked. Horikita started at me intently, as if she were waiting for me to begin. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Ayanokouji-kun? Aren\u2019t you going to eat?\u201d \n \u201cOh.\u201d \n There was definitely a catch, no doubt about it. Nevertheless, I couldn\u2019t just sit here and not eat. Letting the food get cold would be a waste. I hesitantly bit into my croquette. \n \u201cI know this is rather sudden, but I want to talk to you about something.\u201d \n \u201cI have a bad feeling about this\u2026\u201d \n Just as I was preparing to flee, she grabbed my hand. \u201cAyanokouji-kun, I\u2019ll ask once again. Will you listen to me?\u201d \n \u201cUgh\u2026\u201d \n \u201cEver since Chiyabashira-sensei\u2019s warning, fewer people have arrived late or talked in class. When I say we eliminated more than half of the reasons our class got into trouble, I\u2019m not exaggerating.\u201d \n \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true. It wasn\u2019t really a difficult issue to begin with, though.\u201d There was no guarantee things would continue in this vein, but at least these last few days had been considerably better than before. \n \u201cThe next step is to improve our chances of scoring well on the midterm. Hirata-kun started taking action toward that end earlier.\u201d \n \u201cThe study groups, huh? Well, I suppose that a study group certainly could help. Only\u2026\u201d \n \u201cOnly what? It sounds like you\u2019re implying something. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d \n \u201cNothing. Don\u2019t worry about it. I have to say, it\u2019s unusual to see you so worried for others.\u201d \n \u201cI can\u2019t truly imagine failing a test. However, it\u2019s true that some students in this world can do just that.\u201d \n \u201cSudou and the others, you mean? You\u2019re vicious as ever, I see.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m just telling the truth.\u201d \n Because students couldn\u2019t leave campus, contact anyone on the outside, or even attend cram schools, their only option was to help one another. \n \u201cI\u2019m relieved that Hirata-kun set up a study group. However, Sudou-kun, Ike-kun, and Yamauchi-kun didn\u2019t join, did they? That worries me,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cOh, those guys. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re Hirata\u2019s enemies, but they aren\u2019t on good terms with him. They wouldn\u2019t join.\u201d \n \u201cSo, in other words, there remains a high probability that those three will fail. In order to reach Class A, we need to avoid demerits and build toward a positive evaluation, correct? I think it highly likely that good test scores will help with that.\u201d \n I suppose it\u2019s only natural that a student would expect their grade to reflect how much effort they put into the test. \n \u201cWhat if you also held a study group like Hirata\u2019s, specifically for helping Sudou and Ike?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cSure. I wouldn\u2019t have any objections to that. You probably find that rather surprising, though, don\u2019t you?\u201d \n \u201cWell, everything about your behavior up until now has been surprising.\u201d \n I wasn\u2019t actually surprised, though. Horikita was doing this all for her own benefit. Personally, I\u2019d never thought that Horikita was that cold of a person. \n \u201cWell, I understand that you want to move up to Class A. However, I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d opt for ordinary methods like tutoring them. Typically, failing students tend not to like studying. Besides, you\u2019ve kept your distance from the other students since the first day, right? I doubt someone who considers friends unnecessary would be able to bring people together easily.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you. Fortunately, you\u2019re already friendly with these people, right?\u201d \n \u201cHuh? Hey, wait. You couldn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019ll be quicker if you try to convince them. It shouldn\u2019t be a problem; they\u2019re happy to say that you\u2019re friends, right? Bring them to the library, and I\u2019ll tutor them.\u201d \n \u201cThis is insane. Do you honestly think someone who does his best to lead an utterly harmless and inoffensive life would be able to do something that requires actual social skills?\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of can or can\u2019t. Just do it,\u201d she said. \n Was I her pet dog or something? \n \u201cYou can aim for Class A, but don\u2019t involve me.\u201d \n \u201cYou ate the food I treated you to, right? Lunch. The special set. A wonderful, delicious meal.\u201d \n \u201cI simply received the honest goodwill of another human being.\u201d \n \u201cUnfortunately, that wasn\u2019t out of goodwill. I had an ulterior motive.\u201d \n \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t hear a word you said. Here, have some points, my treat . Now we\u2019re even.\u201d \n \u201cI refuse to stoop so low as to accept handouts from others,\u201d she said. \n \u201cI think this might be the first time I\u2019m actually angry at you\u2026\u201d \n \u201cSo what will you do? Cooperate? Or make me your enemy?\u201d \n \u201cIt almost feels like you\u2019re holding a gun to my head.\u201d \n \u201cNo, not \u2018almost.\u2019 I really am threatening you,\u201d replied Horikita. \n The power of violence certainly was effective. Well\u2026if all I did was gather them together, there wasn\u2019t anything particularly wrong with cooperating. After all, due to Horikita\u2019s stance against friendship, she wouldn\u2019t be effective at diplomacy. \n Furthermore, it\u2019d taken a lot of time and trouble to become friends with Sudou and Ike. I\u2019d hate for them to have to drop out so quickly. Sensing my hesitation, Horikita pressed me. \n \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgiven you for conspiring with Kushida-san and inviting me out under false pretenses, do you?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t blame me. Bringing that up is unfair.\u201d \n \u201cI said that to Kushida-san. I don\u2019t remember saying that to you , Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d \n \u201cWow. You play dirty.\u201d \n \u201cIf you want my forgiveness, cooperate with me.\u201d \n It looked as though I\u2019d never had an escape route in the first place. At this juncture, the only way to avoid a hassle would be to help her. \n \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee anything. Are you okay with that?\u201d \n \u201cI believe you\u2019ll find a way. Oh, here\u2019s my phone number and email. If something happens, contact me.\u201d \n Although the circumstances were unusual, I\u2019d gotten a girl\u2019s contact information for the first time in my high school life. It was Horikita\u2019s, though, so I wasn\u2019t particularly happy. \n "], "Chapter 73": ["==============="], "Chapter 74": ["8.2 \n I glanced around the classroom. What was I supposed to do now? If I said, \u201cHey, want to study with me after class?\u201d would anyone even come? \n Sudou and I were close enough that he might, but I wasn\u2019t sure about the others. Well, with nothing to lose, I decided to try. \n \u201cHey, Sudou. Have a minute?\u201d I called as he headed back to the classroom after lunch. He was sweating and a bit short of breath. Probably played some basketball during his lunch break. \n \u201cWhat are you going to do about the midterm?\u201d \n \u201cOh, that. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never really studied seriously before,\u201d he said. \n \u201cOh, yeah? Well, I have just the thing. I wanted to form a study group to meet every day after class, starting today. Want to join?\u201d \n Sudou stared at me, his mouth slightly agape. \n \u201cYou serious? If the lessons are a pain in my ass, why would studying after class be any better? Besides, I have club activities, so it\u2019s pointless. Plus, you\u2019re going to be tutoring? Your scores weren\u2019t great, either.\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that part. Horikita\u2019s the tutor.\u201d \n \u201cHorikita? I don\u2019t really know anything about her. Sounds fishy; I\u2019ll pass. I\u2019ll be fine cramming for the test the night before.\u201d \n Sudou had refused to join, just as I\u2019d guessed. If I persisted, it\u2019d fall on deaf ears. Damn, was it really useless? If I tried to press him further, he might punch me. Perhaps there was no helping it. Maybe I should start with someone more manageable. I called out to Ike, who was playing on his phone. \n \u201cHey, Ike, h\u2014\u201d \n \u201cPass! I heard you talking with Sudou. Study group? No way. Not my thing.\u201d \n \u201cYou do know you\u2019ll be expelled if you fail, right?\u201d \n \u201cWell, yeah. I might have gotten failing grades before, but I\u2019m doing much better now. I\u2019ll just cram the night before with Sudou.\u201d \n Was he really fine with that? He didn\u2019t seem to grasp the danger of this situation. \n \u201cIf the last test hadn\u2019t been such a surprise sucker punch, I probably could\u2019ve gotten, like, forty points.\u201d \n \u201cI know what you mean, but wouldn\u2019t it be better to stick together on this?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cA high school student\u2019s free time is precious, you know? I don\u2019t want to waste it studying.\u201d \n He waved me off, completely focused on texting with some girl. Ever since Hirata had managed to get a girlfriend, Ike was desperate to find a girl of his own. My shoulders slumped as I returned to my seat. Maybe if I told Horikita I\u2019d tried my best, she\u2019d forgive me. \n \u201cNo good,\u201d she said. \n \u201cUh, what do you mean by that?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cI said \u2018no good.\u2019 You really didn\u2019t think it would be that simple, did you?\u201d \n Damn it. She\u2019d completely ignored my appeal. How shameless. \n \u201cNo, of course not. I still have 425 plans remaining,\u201d I grumbled. \n I looked around the room. Contrary to the tension of class, lunch had a friendlier, albeit noisier, atmosphere. \n I needed a method to get reluctant students to buckle down and work. Also, I needed a way to get them to study during free time, not during class. Normally I wouldn\u2019t involve myself, but they were in danger of expulsion. \n I was sure that Sudou would participate if given the chance. Now I had no choice but to find some kind of incentive. I needed him to think there\u2019d be a juicy bonus he\u2019d get by studying. I\u2019d require something concrete and easy to understand. Something effective. \n And then it hit me! \n Blessed with a divine revelation, I turned, wide-eyed, to Horikita. \n \u201cEven though you\u2019re the tutor, getting Sudou and Ike to study is no easy feat. I\u2019ll need more of your abilities. Can you help me?\u201d I asked. \n \u201c\u2018More of my abilities\u2019? What exactly am I supposed to do?\u201d \n \u201cHow about this? If they get a perfect score, you agree to be their girlfriend or something. They\u2019ll definitely jump at the chance if we offer that kind of incentive. Girls are great motivation for guys.\u201d \n \u201cDo you want to die?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cNo, I\u2019d rather live.\u201d \n \u201cI listened because I thought you had a serious plan. I was an idiot to think so.\u201d \n No, I truly believed that\u2019d be effective. It\u2019d be the biggest impetus to study they\u2019d ever had in their entire lives. However, Horikita clearly didn\u2019t understand men. \n \u201cOkay, how about a kiss? If they get a perfect score, you give them a kiss.\u201d \n \u201cSo, you really do want to die?\u201d \n \u201cNo, living would still be preferable.\u201d \n Something sharp jabbed the back of my neck. Damn it. Horikita definitely didn\u2019t acknowledge the value of my methods. It would be exceptionally effective, though. Well, that meant I had to go back to the drawing board. As I considered this, I noticed someone quite conspicuous. It wasn\u2019t Hirata, but another person who might easily rally the class around her: Kushida Kikyou. \n She looked great, of course, and she was bright and energetic. She was so sociable that anyone, regardless of gender, could chat with her freely. Also, Ike was madly in love with Kushida, while Sudou and the others at least had a good impression of her. On top of that, her test scores were relatively high. She was absolutely perfect. \n \u201cHey!\u201d \n Just as I called out, I remembered that Horikita didn\u2019t want to be friends with Kushida. I stopped there. \n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Kushida asked. \n \u201cOh, uh\u2026it\u2019s nothing.\u201d \n Horikita fundamentally disliked mingling with other people. When Kushida and I had tried to enact Operation Friendship, it had made Horikita furious. Horikita probably wouldn\u2019t approve of Kushida\u2019s involvement. I\u2019d put my plan on hold until Horikita returned to the dorms. \n "], "Chapter 75": ["==============="], "Chapter 76": ["8.3 \n B efore I knew it, class had ended for the day. Horikita quickly departed and went straight home. The time had come to enact my plan. I needed to capture Kushida. \n \u201cHey, do you have a minute?\u201d I called out as she prepared to head back to the dorm. Kushida turned around. \n \u201cOh, it\u2019s unusual for you to come talk to me, Ayanokouji-kun. Do you need something?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cYeah. If it\u2019s okay with you, could we talk outside?\u201d \n \u201cWell, I was going to meet up with my friends, so I don\u2019t really have much time, but\u2026okay.\u201d \n Smiling, she followed me, not a trace of unpleasantness to be found. After we turned the hall corner, Kushida waited for me to speak. I was trembling with excitement. \n \u201cRejoice, Kushida. You\u2019ve been selected as an ambassador of goodwill. Tomorrow, your hard work begins.\u201d \n \u201cUh, what? I\u2019m sorry, but what do you mean?\u201d she asked. \n Etc., etc., etc. I basically explained to her that I wanted to form a study group to save Sudou and the others. Of course, I also told her that Horikita would be tutoring. \n \u201cI thought that you could use this study group as a way to get closer to Horikita. What do you think?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cWell, I do want to get closer to her, but\u2026 well, I won\u2019t worry about that now. Besides, it\u2019s only natural to help out a friend in need.\u201d \n This girl was just way too good. She seemed to truly want to prevent Ike and Sudou\u2019s expulsion. \n \u201cAre you really okay with this? If not, I won\u2019t force you to join,\u201d I said. \n \u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t hesitate because I disliked the idea. I hesitated because I was happy.\u201d \n Kushida leaned against the wall, gently kicking it. \n \u201cIt\u2019s cruel to expel someone for getting a bad grade. Isn\u2019t it awful to have to say goodbye after you\u2019ve worked to become friends with everyone? When Hirata-kun told us that he was holding a study group, I greatly admired him. But you could say that Horikita has been much more observant than I. She noticed Sudou and those other guys, after all. It\u2019s like Horikita is now starting to think of her classmates as friends. I\u2019ll do anything I can to be useful!\u201d \n Kushida took my hand and smiled. Whoa, she was seriously way too cute! There wasn\u2019t a man alive who wouldn\u2019t fall for that smile. \n "], "Chapter 77": ["==============="], "Chapter 78": [" filename=\"static\\uploads\\Classroom of the Elite - Volume 01 [Seven Seas][Kobo]\\images\\image15.jpg\"", "==============="], "Chapter 79": ["I couldn\u2019t afford to get carried away, though. I tried to look safe and inoffensive. \n \u201cGreat! We could definitely use your help. If you\u2019re there, our chances will improve a hundred times over.\u201d \n \u201cAh, but there\u2019s just one thing I want to ask you. I want to participate in the study group, too,\u201d Kushida said. \n \u201cHuh? Really?\u201d \n \u201cYes. I want to study with everyone.\u201d \n My wishes had all come true. Kushida\u2019s presence would brighten our study group, which would otherwise be pretty glum. However, since she didn\u2019t get bad grades, there really wasn\u2019t a reason for her to be there. \n \u201cSo then, when do we start?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cWe plan on starting tomorrow.\u201d In my mind, I added, Horikita does, at least . \n \u201cI see. Then I\u2019ll have to talk to everyone by the end of the day. I\u2019ll contact you later, okay?\u201d \n \u201cOh, do you need Sudou and the others\u2019 contact information?\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I already have it. The only people whose numbers I don\u2019t have are you and Horikita-san, actually\u2026\u201d \n Well, I hadn\u2019t known that. \n \u201cThis might be too forward, but are you two already dating?\u201d Kushida asked. \n \u201cWh-where did you hear that? Horikita and I are friends\u2026no, just neighbors.\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s a big rumor among the girls in our class, you know. They say that even though Horikita-san is always alone, she only seems to get along really well with you, Ayanokouji-kun. And you guys eat together, after all.\u201d \n Hmm, so the girls had already started spreading rumors about us. \n \u201cThat\u2019s a shame, because, unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing going on like that between me and Horikita.\u201d \n \u201cSo, there\u2019s no problem swapping phone numbers, right?\u201d \n \u201cNot at all.\u201d \n And so, I got another girl\u2019s number. \n "], "Chapter 80": ["==============="], "Chapter 81": ["8.4 \n I WAS LAZING AROUND my room that night when I received a text message from Kushida. \n Yamauchi-kun and Ike-kun said okay! ( \u30fb w \u30fb )b \n That was fast. \n Ike had waved me off when I\u2019d tried to invite him earlier. A girl\u2019s presence had likely played a large part in changing his mind. Lust held unlimited power. \n I just contacted Sudou right now, but I have a good feeling about it! (^w^) \n Another text message. Wow. At this rate, we\u2019d probably get everyone together tomorrow. Because of these speedy developments, I thought it\u2019d be a good idea to relay information to Horikita. I wrote a message basically saying I had Kushida\u2019s help, that Ike and Yamauchi had agreed to come, and that Kushida would also be participating. Then I sent the message to Horikita. \n \u201cAll right. Time to take a bath, I think.\u201d \n The moment I rose from my bed, Horikita called. \n \u201cHello?\u201d I answered. \n \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand the message you just sent me,\u201d she said. \n \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t understand? I wrote it all out plain as day, didn\u2019t I? I said those three guys would probably come tomorrow.\u201d \n \u201cNot that part. The part about Kushida. I didn\u2019t know about that.\u201d \n \u201cI asked her a little while ago. Having someone like Kushida on our side increases the odds of getting everyone together. So I asked her, and now Sudou and Ike and Yamauchi are coming. Okay?\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t remember giving you permission to do that. Her grades aren\u2019t even failing.\u201d \n \u201cOkay, look. By asking Kushida, who\u2019s spent more time networking, to help us, our chances of success have improved significantly.\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t like it. Shouldn\u2019t you have sought my approval first?\u201d \n \u201cI understand that you hate outgoing people like Kushida. But isn\u2019t this just a means to an end? Or would you prefer trying to gather everyone yourself?\u201d \n \u201cWell\u2026\u201d \n Horikita seemed to finally understand that getting Kushida on board was a good thing. But, being prideful, she couldn\u2019t simply agree to it. \n \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time until the test, either. Understand?\u201d \n Come to think of it, we really didn\u2019t have much time to make Horikita\u2019s plan work. However, Horikita was clearly stuck and unable to make a snap decision. She remained silent for a moment. \n \u201cI understand. I suppose anything worth doing requires sacrifice. However, Kushida may only help gather the students. She\u2019s not allowed to join the study group.\u201d \n \u201cBut why? That was her condition for helping us. You\u2019re being ridiculous,\u201d I said. \n \u201cI will not allow her into our study group. I refuse to budge on this.\u201d \n \u201cIs this about what happened at the caf\u00e9? Are you just getting back at Kushida for deceiving you?\u201d \n \u201cThis has nothing to do with that. She didn\u2019t fail the test. Inviting extra people will only mean more time spent and greater confusion.\u201d \n Although her argument sounded logical, I doubted that was her real reason for excluding Kushida. \n \u201cDo you openly dislike Kushida?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cDon\u2019t you feel uncomfortable sitting next to someone you hate?\u201d \n \u201cHuh?\u201d \n I didn\u2019t really understand what Horikita meant. Kushida had tried harder than anyone to befriend Horikita. I couldn\u2019t imagine why Horikita actually hated Kushida. \n \u201cSuppose the guys decide not to come if Kushida\u2019s out?\u201d \n \u201cSorry, reviewing these test materials is taking longer than I expected. I\u2019m ending the call here. Goodnight.\u201d \n \u201cHey, wait!\u201d \n She hung up on me, as expected of a misanthrope. However, if we wanted to reach Class A, compromise was necessary. I plugged my phone into my charger and lay down, thinking through everything that had happened since the entrance ceremony. \n \u201cDefective product, huh?\u201d \n That was what that second-year student had called us on our first day. In other words, we weren\u2019t just defective; we were fundamentally failing to serve our purpose. Those were the words they\u2019d used to ridicule us. Even Horikita, who appeared flawless, probably had some defects of her own. I could kind of understand why she\u2019d been angry today. \n \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d \n Should I try to force Horikita? In the worst-case scenario, she\u2019d leave. If Horikita didn\u2019t tutor the study group, it\u2019d waste everyone\u2019s time. With a heavy heart, I called Kushida. \n \u201cHello?\u201d \n I heard something like a strong wind blowing into the phone. It quickly died down, though. \n \u201cWere you drying your hair or something?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cOh, sorry. Did you hear that? I just finished up, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d \n Kushida had just gotten out of the bath\u2026 This wasn\u2019t the time to get lost in fantasies. \n \u201cUh, this is really hard for me to tell you, but\u2026 Can we pretend that I never asked you to help get everybody together?\u201d \n She paused and then replied, \u201cUm, why?\u201d She sounded curious rather than angry. \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t explain right now. Things got kind of complicated.\u201d \n \u201cIs that so? I suppose Horikita-san was opposed to me joining.\u201d \n I hadn\u2019t implied that, but Kushida had managed to pick up on it. \u201cIt has nothing to do with Horikita. It\u2019s my bad.\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not particularly angry. Horikita seems to really dislike me, so I expected she\u2019d refuse.\u201d \n You could call it a woman\u2019s intuition. \n \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my bad, since I came to you for help and all.\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to apologize, Ayanokouji-kun. But, I\u2026don\u2019t think that Horikita-san will be able to bring Sudou-kun and the others together by herself.\u201d \n I couldn\u2019t deny it. \n \u201cHey, what did Horikita-san say, though? Was she against me gathering people, or did she not want me to join the study group?\u201d \n Kushida was so dead-on, it was like she\u2019d been standing next to me when Horikita called. \n \u201cThe latter. I\u2019m really sorry to hurt your feelings.\u201d \n \u201cAhh, it\u2019s okay. Really, don\u2019t apologize, Ayanokouji-kun. Horikita-san has this kind of impenetrable aura around her, like she won\u2019t let people get close to her. I expected this.\u201d \n She was way too perceptive. \n \u201cEveryone agreed to join because I said I\u2019d participate, though\u2026 Couldn\u2019t you have just lied and told me that I couldn\u2019t join? I\u2019m worried that if they know I\u2019m not coming now, the guys will probably get mad at Horikita-san\u2026\u201d \n Kushida scared me a bit. Nothing escaped her. \n \u201cCould you leave things to me this time?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cLeave it to you?\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019ll bring everyone over tomorrow. Of course, I\u2019ll be coming along, too.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d I started. \n \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. Or can you solve all of these problems, Ayanokouji-kun? You know, gather everyone together without me?\u201d \n Unfortunately, such a thing was probably impossible. \n \u201cI understand. I\u2019ll leave it to you, then. I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen, though.\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You won\u2019t be responsible for anything, Ayanokouji-kun. Well then, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d \n Soon after, my call with Kushida ended. Somehow, I was even more exhausted than when I\u2019d finished talking to Horikita. Even though Kushida said everything was fine, I had my doubts. \n Horikita relentlessly opposed anyone she didn\u2019t like, regardless of who they were. It was painfully obvious that this would end in disaster. Feeling anxious, I headed into the bathroom. \n I decided to stop thinking about tomorrow. No matter how much I agonized over it, tomorrow would come, and it would eventually end. Things would work out, somehow. \n "], "Chapter 82": ["==============="], "Chapter 83": ["8.5 \n H orikita had been sullen all morning. It would\u2019ve been nice if she got adorable when she was angry. If she puffed out her reddened cheeks, she\u2019d be cute enough to make any man would swoon. However, she remained expressionless and silent, refusing to acknowledge my existence. If I were to ignore her, though, she\u2019d probably take out her compass. After an especially long day, we finally finished class. \n \u201cHave you gathered everyone in the study group?\u201d \n Her first words to me included \u201cstudy group.\u201d She was most definitely implying something. \n \u201cKushida\u2019s bringing them. I wonder if she\u2019ll participate,\u201d I replied. \n \u201cKushida-san, hmm? I thought I specified that she wasn\u2019t allowed to participate\u2026\u201d \n Satisfied, Horikita left for the library, and I followed. Kushida gave me a too-cute wink as I left. Together, Horikita and I secured a long table at the far end of the library and waited for the others. \n \u201cI\u2019ve brought everyone!\u201d \n Kushida came over to where we were seated. Behind her was\u2026 \n \u201cKushida-chan told us about this study group. I don\u2019t want to be expelled after only just starting. Thanks!\u201d \n Ike, Yamauchi, and Sudou had all shown up. However, they\u2019d brought an unexpected visitor, a boy named Okitani. \n \u201cHuh? Okitani, you failed, too?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cOh, n-no. Not exactly. I was just really close to failing, so I was worried\u2026 Is it not, er, okay for me to join you? It\u2019s a little difficult to join Hirata\u2019s group\u2026\u201d Okitani looked up at me, puffing out his cute, slightly reddened cheeks. He was slender, with blue hair cut in a short bob. A boy attracted to anything feminine might have shouted \u201cI\u2019m in love!\u201d right away. If Okitani weren\u2019t a man, it would have been dangerous. \n \u201cIs it okay if Okitani-kun joins us, too?\u201d Kushida asked Horikita. Okitani had scored thirty-nine on the test, after all. He likely wanted to participate just to be safe. \n \u201cAs long as you\u2019re worried about failing, I don\u2019t mind. But you need to be serious,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cOh, okay.\u201d \n Okitani sat down, seemingly happy. Kushida tried to sit next to him, which Horikita certainly noticed. \n \u201cKushida-san, did Ayanokouji-kun not tell you? You\u2014\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m also worried about getting a bad grade,\u201d Kushida said. \n \u201cYou\u2026didn\u2019t score badly on the small test.\u201d \n \u201cYes, but to tell you the truth, I was lucky. There were lots of multiple-choice questions, you know? So I guessed about half of them. In truth, I just barely passed.\u201d \n Kushida giggled adorably, lightly scratching her cheek. \n \u201cI think that I\u2019m about on the same level as Okitani-kun, if not slightly worse. So I want to join the study group to avoid getting a bad grade. That\u2019s okay, right?\u201d \n I couldn\u2019t hide my surprise at Kushida\u2019s unexpected scheme. She\u2019d first confirmed that Okitani could join the study group, then turned the tables on Horikita. Now Horikita would have to permit her to join. \n \u201cFine,\u201d Horikita growled. \n \u201cThank you.\u201d Kushida smiled, bowed, and took her seat. Bringing Okitani had probably been part of her plan all along. She\u2019d effectively used him to justify joining the group. \n \u201cScoring lower than thirty-two means failing. Do you fail if you get exactly thirty-two points, though?\u201d Sudou asked. \n \u201cNo, you\u2019re safe if you score at least thirty-two points. Sudou, you can manage that, right?\u201d Ike said. \n Even Ike was worried about Sudou. Of course those guys would want to know the exact threshold. \n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter. My goal is for everyone to score fifty,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cGah, isn\u2019t that going to be too tough?\u201d \n \u201cAiming to just skate by is dangerous. The fact that you can\u2019t easily reach that threshold troubles me.\u201d \n In the face of Horikita\u2019s sound argument, the failures simply nodded reluctantly. \n \u201cI included most of what will be covered on this test. We only have about two weeks left, but I plan to thoroughly walk you through everything. If you don\u2019t understand something, please ask.\u201d \n \u201cHey, I don\u2019t understand the first question.\u201d Sudou glared at Horikita. I tried reading the first problem as well. \n \u201cA, B, and C collectively have 2,150 yen. A has 120 yen more than B does. Also, after C gives B two-fifths of his money, B would have 220 yen more than A. How much yen did A originally start with?\u201d \n A problem with simultaneous equations, huh? The first test question should have been one that a high school student could easily solve. \n \u201cTry thinking about it. If you give up right at the beginning, you won\u2019t get anywhere.\u201d \n \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know how to study at all,\u201d Sudou said. \n \u201cEveryone got into this school.\u201d \n This school didn\u2019t accept people based solely on test scores, though. Sudou had most likely been accepted because of his exceptional physical ability. If you looked at it that way, wouldn\u2019t he likely be expelled because of bad grades? \n \u201cUgh, I don\u2019t get it either.\u201d Ike, equally bewildered, scratched his head. \n \u201cDo you understand, Okitani-kun?\u201d Horikita asked. \n \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 A plus B plus C is 2,150 yen. So, A equals B plus 120. Then\u2026\u201d Okitani started writing out a series of equations. Kushida, seated next to him, glanced over her shoulder. \n \u201cYeah, yeah, that looks right. Then what?\u201d \n You could certainly call Kushida bold, or even audacious. She\u2019d claimed to have just barely avoided failing, and she was now teaching Okitani. \n \u201cHonestly, first- and second-year junior high school students could easily solve this problem. If you stumble here, it\u2019ll be impossible for you to continue,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cSo, what, we\u2019re like elementary school kids?\u201d Sudou growled. \n \u201cLike Horikita-san said, it\u2019ll be bad if you get tripped up here. The math problems on the short test were about this difficult, but the last problems were really tough. I didn\u2019t understand how to solve them,\u201d Okitani said. \n \u201cListen up. This can be easily solved using a system of simultaneous equations.\u201d Without hesitation, Horikita picked up her pen and got to work. Unfortunately, it looked like only Kushida and Okitani understood. \n \u201cWhat even are simultaneous equations?\u201d asked Ike. \n \u201cAre you seriously asking me that?\u201d said Horikita. \n Wow, these guys had really never studied at all, it seemed. Sudou threw his mechanical pencil onto the desk. \n \u201cStop. I\u2019m done. This isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d \n Sudou had quit before we could even begin. Horikita quietly seethed at this pitiful display. \n \u201cW-wait, everyone. Let\u2019s give it a shot. If you learn how to solve these problems, you can apply what you learn to the questions on the test. Okay? Okay?\u201d Kushida said. \n \u201cWell, if Kushida-chan says so, I guess I can try. But if Kushida-chan were teaching, I\u2019d probably try even harder.\u201d \n \u201cU-um\u2026\u201d Kushida seemed ready to ask Horikita about that, but Horikita stayed silent. Her refusal to even answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d was troubling. However, if she remained silent much longer, the failures might abandon this study group. Kushida made up her mind and grabbed the mechanical pencil. \n \u201cLike Horikita-san said, you can solve this problem by using a system of simultaneous equations. So let\u2019s try writing them out.\u201d \n Quickly, she wrote down three equations. It looked like the others were trying their best, but it still seemed hopeless. This was more like detention than a study group. They didn\u2019t seem to understand her methods in the slightest. \n \u201cSo, the answer I got is 710 yen. What did you get?\u201d \n Kushida, confident in Sudou\u2019s ability to follow along, flashed him a smile. \n \u201cUm, so you used this to get the answer? How?\u201d he asked. \n \u201cUh\u2026\u201d Kushida immediately realized what had happened. None of them understood. \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re far too ignorant and incompetent,\u201d said Horikita, who\u2019d been silent until now. \u201cIf you can\u2019t solve this problem, I seriously shiver at the thought of what the future will bring.\u201d \n \u201cShut up. This has nothing to do with you.\u201d Sudou slammed the desk, understandably irritated by Horikita. \n \u201cYou\u2019re right. This has nothing to do with me. Your suffering won\u2019t influence me at all. I just pity you. You must have spent your whole life running from anything that presented a challenge,\u201d she said. \n \u201cSay whatever you want. Academics will be useless in the future, anyway.\u201d \n \u201cAcademics will be useless in the future? That\u2019s an interesting argument. How do you justify that?\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t care if I can\u2019t solve this problem. Studying\u2019s useless. Aiming to become a pro basketball player will help me a lot more.\u201d \n \u201cIncorrect. Once you learn to solve these kinds of problems, your entire life will change. In other words, studying increases the possibility that you\u2019ll solve the problems you face. It\u2019s the same principle as basketball. I wonder if, so far, you\u2019ve been playing basketball by your own set of rules. When you struggle in basketball, do you run away from it like you do from studying? I doubt you take basketball practice seriously. You\u2019re a natural troublemaker, someone who always causes a disruption. If I were your adviser, I wouldn\u2019t let you on the team.\u201d \n \u201cTch!\u201d Sudou got in close to Horikita and grabbed her by the collar. \n \u201cSudou-kun!\u201d Kushida grabbed Sudou\u2019s arm faster than I could move. Despite Sudou\u2019s intimidations, Horikita didn\u2019t flinch. She simply fixed Sudou with an icy glare. \n \u201cYou don\u2019t interest me in the slightest, but I can tell what kind of person you are just by looking at you. You want to play professional basketball? Do you honestly believe you can make such a childish dream come true in this world? A simpleton like you who gives up right away could never hope to go pro. Furthermore, even if you managed to become a professional player, I doubt you\u2019d earn an annual income sufficient to live on. You\u2019re a fool to have such unreasonable aspirations.\u201d \n \u201cYou!\u201d \n It was clear that Sudou was on the brink of losing control. If he raised his fist, I\u2019d have to wrestle him down. \n \u201cSo, you\u2019re just going to immediately give up on studying or on school in general? Then discard your dreams of playing basketball and spend your days toiling away at a pitiful part-time job.\u201d \n \u201cHmph. That\u2019s just fine. I\u2019ll quit, but it\u2019s not because it\u2019s difficult. I took a day off from my club activities for this, and it ended up being a complete waste of time. Later!\u201d Sudou said. \n \u201cWhat an odd thing to say. Studying is difficult.\u201d Horikita took a parting shot at Sudou. If Kushida weren\u2019t there, Sudou probably would have smacked Horikita. He stuffed his textbooks into his bag, not even hiding his irritation. \n \u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t care. It\u2019s pointless to care about someone who lacks any motivation whatsoever. Even though he\u2019s facing expulsion, he has no will to fight.\u201d \n \u201cI thought that it was weird for someone like you, who doesn\u2019t have any friends, to put this study group together. You probably just wanted to call us stupid. If you weren\u2019t a girl, I\u2019d smack you.\u201d \n \u201cSo, you lack the courage to hit me? Don\u2019t use my gender as an excuse,\u201d Horikita said. \n The newly assembled study group was already falling apart. \n \u201cI\u2019m quitting, too. Partly \u2019cause I can\u2019t deal with studying, but mostly \u2019cause I\u2019m annoyed. You might be smart, Horikita-san, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can act like you\u2019re better than us.\u201d Ike, clearly fed up, threw in the towel as well. \n \u201cI don\u2019t care if you get expelled. Do what you want,\u201d Horikita shot back. \n \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just pull an all-nighter.\u201d \n \u201cInteresting. Didn\u2019t you come here because you can\u2019t study?\u201d \n \u201cTch\u2026\u201d Even the typically easygoing Ike stiffened under the sting of Horikita\u2019s barbed comments. Yamauchi started putting his textbook away as well. Finally, the easily influenced Okitani got out of his seat. \n \u201cI-Is this really okay, everyone?\u201d he stammered. \n \u201cLet\u2019s go, Okitani.\u201d \n Ike left the library, trailed by the hesitant Okitani. Now only Kushida, Horikita, and I remained. Soon, even Kushida would probably reach her limit and leave. \n \u201cHorikita-san, we\u2019re not going to be able to study with anyone if things continue like this\u2026\u201d Kushida murmured. \n \u201cI was certainly mistaken. Even if I\u2019d helped them avoid failure this time, we would\u2019ve faced a similar dilemma soon after. We\u2019d have to go through this irritation all over again. Eventually, they\u2019ll fail. I finally understand how unproductive this was. I don\u2019t have the time for it.\u201d \n \u201cWait, what do you mean?\u201d \n \u201cI mean that it\u2019s better to get rid of the dead weight.\u201d \n That was Horikita\u2019s ultimate conclusion. If the failing students were expelled, then the class\u2019s average test scores would go up, and we wouldn\u2019t have to expend any extra effort. \n \u201cSo, that\u2019s\u2026 H-hey, Ayanokouji-kun. Can you say something?\u201d Kushida murmured. \n \u201cIf that\u2019s Horikita\u2019s answer, then isn\u2019t it fine?\u201d \n \u201cYou think so too, Ayanokouji-kun?\u201d \n \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to toss them to the wolves or anything, but I\u2019m not the tutor. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201d In the end, I felt similarly to Horikita. \n \u201cOkay. I see.\u201d Kushida grabbed her bag and stood up, her expression darkening. \u201cI\u2019m going to do something. Well, I\u2019ll try. I definitely don\u2019t want everything to fall apart so quickly.\u201d \n \u201cKushida-san. Do you really feel that way?\u201d \n \u201cIs it wrong? I don\u2019t want to abandon Sudou-kun, Ike-kun, and Yamauchi-kun.\u201d \n \u201cEven if that was how you truly felt, I wouldn\u2019t particularly care. But I don\u2019t think that you actually want to save them,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t understand. Why do you say things like that, Horikita-san? Why do you try to antagonize people? That\u2019s\u2026very sad.\u201d \n Kushida hung her head briefly, then looked back up at us. She met our eyes. \n \u201cWell then. I\u2019ll see you two tomorrow,\u201d she whispered. \n With that, Kushida left. Suddenly, it was just the two of us again. We sat in the complete silence of the library. \n \u201cWell, that was painful. The study group\u2019s already over,\u201d I said. \n \u201cLooks that way.\u201d \n The quiet grew almost oppressive. \n \u201cI suppose you were the only one who understood me, Ayanokouji-kun. You\u2019re at least somewhat better than those worthless idiots. If there\u2019s some subject you\u2019re struggling with, I could teach you.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019ll pass, thank you.\u201d \n \u201cAre you going back to your dorm?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cI\u2019m going to find Sudou and the others and have a chat with them.\u201d \n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be gained from associating with people who\u2019ll likely be expelled soon.\u201d \n \u201cI just want to talk to my friends. Do you have a problem with that?\u201d \n \u201cHow incredibly selfish. You call them your friends, yet you simply stand by and watch as they\u2019re expelled. From my point of view, you\u2019re cruel.\u201d \n Well, I certainly couldn\u2019t deny that. Horikita wasn\u2019t wrong. In the end, studying was just the test of an individual\u2019s self-motivation. \n \u201cI won\u2019t deny what you\u2019ve said. I can also understand why you\u2019d call someone like Sudou stupid. However, Horikita, shouldn\u2019t you try to understand Sudou\u2019s situation? If he only hoped to become a professional basketball player, then choosing this school in the first place makes little sense. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019d understand him better if you considered his reasons for enrolling?\u201d \n \u201cNot interested.\u201d Horikita dismissed me and returned to her textbook. Alone. \n "], "Chapter 84": ["==============="], "Chapter 85": ["8.6 \n I left the library and chased after Kushida. I wanted to thank for her working so hard to get the study group together, and to apologize. Besides, I wanted to do everything possible to get along with such a cute girl, you know? \n Whipping out my cell phone, I pulled up Kushida\u2019s contact information. Although it was my second time calling, I felt nervous contacting her. The phone rang twice, then three times. However, she didn\u2019t pick up. Did she not notice me calling? Or was she refusing to answer it? \n Kushida wasn\u2019t around campus, so I continued to search for her. When I got inside the school, I glimpsed someone who looked like Kushida from behind. It was already around six PM , so the only people here should\u2019ve been involved in club activities. Well, this was Kushida we were talking about. She was probably waiting for one of her good friends to finish club stuff. \n I decided to keep up the chase. If she were busy, I\u2019d talk to her again later. Bearing that in mind, I pressed on. I took out a pair of indoor shoes from the cubicles in the hallway, but didn\u2019t see Kushida. Had I lost her? I thought I had, until I heard the faint clack of shoes. \n I followed her up the stairs to the second floor. The sound of footsteps continued up to the third floor. The next level after that was the roof, wasn\u2019t it? Students were free to use the roof during lunchtime, but it should\u2019ve been locked after class. While I thought it strange, I went up the stairs, trying to hide my presence as best I could in case she was meeting with someone. Then, I stopped partway. \n Someone was up there. \n I gently leaned against the handrail and peeked through a crack in the rooftop door. Through the opening, I glimpsed Kushida. No one else was with her. Was she waiting for someone? \n A rendezvous at such a secluded place\u2026 Could she possibly be waiting for her boyfriend? If that were the case, I could end up cornered on all sides. While I agonized over how to sneak away, Kushida slowly set her bag down on the ground. \n And then\u2026 \n \u201cAhhh, so annoying!\u201d \n Her voice was so low that it didn\u2019t sound at all like Kushida. \n \u201cShe\u2019s seriously annoying! God, how irritating. It\u2019d be better if she just died \u2026\u201d \n She grumbled to herself, as if chanting the words to some kind of spell or curse. \n \u201cUgh, I hate stuck-up, snobby girls who think they\u2019re so cute. Why is she such a harpy? A rotten girl like her couldn\u2019t possibly tutor me.\u201d \n Was Kushida annoyed with\u2026Horikita? \n \u201cAh, she\u2019s the worst! She\u2019s just the worst, the worst, the worst! Horikita, you\u2019re so annoying! You\u2019re so damn annoying!\u201d \n I felt like I\u2019d glimpsed another side of this gentle girl, the most popular person in our class. She probably didn\u2019t want anyone else to see this darker side. A voice in my head whispered that it was dangerous to stay here. \n However, an odd question arose. Why had she agreed to work with me if she felt such hatred toward Horikita? Kushida should have understood Horikita\u2019s personality and behavior perfectly well by now. She could have refused to help, or just left the study group to Horikita, or otherwise washed her hands of involvement. \n Why force herself into the study group? Did she want to get along with Horikita? Or did she want to become closer to another participant? \n None of it made sense. I couldn\u2019t explain her reasoning. \n No. She may have shown signs of this from the very beginning. I hadn\u2019t really thought about it before, but considering the state she was in right now, I had a hunch. Perhaps, Kushida and Horikita were\u2026 \n At any rate, I needed to get away from there. Kushida probably didn\u2019t want anyone else to hear her diatribe. Still hiding, I quickly tried to leave. \n Thump ! \n I\u2019d kicked the door much louder than I\u2019d anticipated. It\u2019d been unexpectedly loud, really. Kushida tensed and stopped breathing. I\u2019d instantly become her enemy. Turning, Kushida set her sights on me. I\u2019d been seen. \n After a brief silence, Kushida coldly asked, \u201cWhat\u2026are you\u2026doing here?\u201d \n \u201cI got a little lost. Sorry. My bad, my bad. I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d \n Kushida looked straight at me, clearly seeing through my obvious lie. I\u2019d never seen such an intense gaze before. \n \u201cDid you hear?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cWould you believe me if I said I didn\u2019t?\u201d I replied. \n \u201cI see\u2026\u201d \n Kushida briskly walked down the stairs. She placed her left forearm against the base of my throat, and pushed me up against the wall. Her tone of voice, her actions, everything about her was completely unlike the Kushida I knew. This new Kushida wore a terrifying expression, one that I could almost compare to Horikita\u2019s. \n \u201cIf you tell anyone what you just heard, I won\u2019t forgive you.\u201d \n Her words were ice, and I didn\u2019t think they were an idle threat. \n \u201cAnd if I did tell?\u201d \n \u201cIn that case, I would tell everyone that you raped me,\u201d she said. \n \u201cThat\u2019s a false charge, you know.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s okay. It wouldn\u2019t be false.\u201d \n Her words had heft and power, leaving me unable to reply. As she spoke, Kushida grabbed my right wrist and slowly opened my hand. She pushed my palm up against her soft breast. \n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked. I hurriedly tried to pull away, but she pushed on the back of my hand. \n \u201cYour fingerprints are on my clothes. That\u2019s evidence of my claim. I\u2019m being serious. Understand?\u201d \n \u201cI understand. I really do. So let go of my hand.\u201d \n "], "Chapter 86": ["==============="], "Chapter 87": [" filename=\"static\\uploads\\Classroom of the Elite - Volume 01 [Seven Seas][Kobo]\\images\\image16.jpg\"", "==============="], "Chapter 88": ["\u201cI\u2019m going to leave this uniform in my room without washing it. If you betray me, I\u2019ll hand it over to the police.\u201d \n I glared at Kushida for a while as she kept my hand pressed against her. \n \u201cIt\u2019s a promise,\u201d she said. \n Kushida stepped away from me. Even though this was the first time I had felt a girl\u2019s breasts, I found I couldn\u2019t remember the sensation. \n \u201cHey, Kushida. Which is the real you?\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d \n \u201cI see. Well, I was wondering something. If you hate Horikita, then you don\u2019t need to involve yourself with her, right?\u201d \n I knew she probably wouldn\u2019t like that question, but I was curious about her motivation. \n \u201cIs it bad to want everyone to like you? Do you understand how difficult it is to accomplish that? You can\u2019t know, can you?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have that many friends, so I guess not.\u201d \n Ever since the first day of school, Kushida had made an effort to exchange contact information with, invite out, and, of course, talk with the pessimistic Horikita. One could easily imagine how difficult and time-consuming that would be. \n \u201cAt least on the surface, I wanted to appear to get along with Horikita.\u201d \n \u201cBut the stress of that just kept building, huh?\u201d \n \u201cYeah. That\u2019s what I want out of life, though. That way, my existence has meaning.\u201d She answered without hesitation. Kushida had a singular way of thinking. Her own internal rules demanded she get close to Horikita. \n \u201cLet me tell you something, while I have the chance. I absolutely despise gloomy, ordinary guys like you.\u201d \n The fantasy of a cute Kushida that I\u2019d carried until now had been shattered, but I wasn\u2019t actually that shocked. Most people possessed both a public face and a private, inner self, after all. However, I felt like Kushida was both telling the truth and lying right now. \n \u201cI\u2019m just speculating, but did you and Horikita know each other before this year? Maybe you both attended the same school in the past?\u201d \n The instant I said it, Kushida shuddered in response. \n \u201cWhat the\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you mean. Did Horikita-san say something about me?\u201d she snapped. \n \u201cNo, I had the impression that this was the first time you\u2019d met. But something seemed strange.\u201d \n \u201cStrange?\u201d \n I recalled the first time Kushida had spoken to me. \n \u201cYou learned my name only when I first introduced myself, right?\u201d \n \u201cSo what?\u201d Kushida responded flatly. \n \u201cWell, where did you learn Horikita\u2019s name? Back then, she hadn\u2019t introduced herself to anyone yet. The only person who knew was Sudou, but I doubt you\u2019d met him by then.\u201d \n In other words, Kushida wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to learn Horikita\u2019s name. \n \u201cYou got close to me so you could spy on her, right?\u201d \n \u201cJust shut up. Hearing you talk irritates me, Ayanokouji-kun. I only want to know one thing. Do you swear you\u2019ll never tell anyone what you learned here today?\u201d \n \u201cI swear. Even if I did, it\u2019s not like anyone would believe me. Right?\u201d \n The entire class trusted and loved Kushida. The difference between us was like night and day. \n \u201cOkay. I believe you, Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d Kushida closed her eyes and slowly exhaled. \u201cHorikita-san is rather unusual, isn\u2019t she?\u201d \n \u201cYes, I\u2019d say she\u2019s really unusual.\u201d \n \u201cOther people don\u2019t influence her, or rather, she keeps her distance from everyone else. She\u2019s the complete opposite of me.\u201d \n Kushida and Horikita really were polar opposites. \n \u201cYou know, Ayanokouji-kun, you\u2019re the only one that Horikita-san opens up to.\u201d \n \u201cWait a minute. She doesn\u2019t open up to me. Absolutely not.\u201d \n \u201cEven so, she seems to trust you more than anyone else. Out of all the people I\u2019ve ever met, Horikita seems the most wary of others and yet also the most self-confident. She certainly wouldn\u2019t trust anyone worthless, even if they were unbelievably kind.\u201d \n \u201cSo, you think she has good instincts for people?\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s why I said I believed you. Ayanokouji-kun, you\u2019re fundamentally indifferent to other people, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n I didn\u2019t remember doing anything that would make her think so, but Kushida seemed confident in her assessment. \n \u201cIt\u2019s not an out-of-place judgment. Back on the bus, you didn\u2019t show any interest in giving up your seat to the elderly woman.\u201d \n Ah, so that\u2019s what she was talking about. She\u2019d picked up on what was happening that first day. She had understood that I\u2019d no intention of giving up my seat. \n \u201cIf you believe I\u2019m telling the truth, then you won\u2019t spread pointless rumors,\u201d I said. \n \u201cIf you were really so confident, you wouldn\u2019t have felt up my breasts.\u201d \n \u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026 I was really flustered. I panicked for a second.\u201d \n Her stern expression melted into one of impatience. \n \u201cSo, Kushida, would I be right to think of you as the kind of girl who lets guys touch her breasts?\u201d \n She kicked my thigh as hard she could. Panicking, I grabbed the railing. \n \u201cHey, watch it! I could\u2019ve fallen and gotten seriously hurt!\u201d \n \u201cI kicked you because you said something stupid!\u201d Kushida snapped, her face flushed from anger. \n \u201cHey, wait a minute.\u201d \n She still looked furious. Kushida tromped back up the stairs, grabbed her bag, then returned wearing a huge grin. \n \u201cLet\u2019s head back together,\u201d she said brightly. \n \u201cOh. Sure.\u201d \n Her attitude had drastically changed, like something out of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde . It was so drastic that I wondered whether I\u2019d had a bad dream. She was her usual sunny self once more. I couldn\u2019t tell which Kushida was the real one. \n "], "Chapter 89": ["==============="], "Chapter 90": ["8.7 \n I wondered what was going to happen with Class D. Honestly, part of me felt like these were other people\u2019s problems. Back in my room, I started to watch some kind of variety show with a feeling of complete apathy. Glancing at my phone, I saw I had a message from the group chat. \n The message read, Satou\u2019s joining the group. Satou was a particularly high-spirited girl in our class. \n Hiya! Ike-kun invited me to join when we were talking earlier. \n With nothing to contribute, I didn\u2019t respond and continued reading. \n I heard about what happened today. Horikita is really frustrating, huh? \n I was really pissed at her. Sudou was super mad. He almost lost it. I think he would\u2019ve hit her. \n If I see her tomorrow, I might hit her. I was really annoyed with her today. \n Aha ha ha, it\u2019ll be a big problem if you hit her lol. That would be overkill! \n Hey, I have an idea. Starting tomorrow, how about we completely ignore her? \n Ha, I\u2019ve always ignored her (lol) \n I kind of want to hit her with some payback. Bully her a little and make her cry, you know? Do something like hide her shoes. \n Ha ha, what are you, kids? Lol lol lol but I do kind of want to see her squirm. \n Soon after Satou joined the group chat, Horikita became the main topic of discussion. \n Hey, Ayanokouji-kun, you want in on bullying Horikita lol \n Nah, Ayanokouji-kun is all obsessed with her, so he probably can\u2019t. \n Hey, whose side are you on? Ours or Horikita\u2019s? \n I supposed everyone\u2019s irritation with Horikita was inevitable. If you treated others the way Horikita did, you\u2019d inevitably be disliked. But hitting her would be going too far, and I couldn\u2019t understand how anyone might condone ignoring her or hiding her things. That was bullying, and acting like that would leave little difference between them and Horikita. \n Hey, you\u2019re reading the chat, right? Hey! Ayanokouji-kun, whose side are you on? \n I\u2019m on no one\u2019s side. If you guys want to bully her, I won\u2019t stop you. \n So, you\u2019re neutral. That\u2019s the craftiest answer lol. \n Think whatever you want, but you won\u2019t gain anything from this. If the school learns you\u2019re bullying her, it\u2019ll cause trouble for you. Keep that in mind. \n So, you\u2019re sticking up for Horikita, huh? Ha ha. \n Because we couldn\u2019t see each other face to face, it was easier for them to be jerks. If Ike and I were having this conversation in person, I doubted he\u2019d act this way. \n However, by focusing their anger on Horikita, the others were building solidarity. It would be a waste of time to continue pointlessly chatting like this. I decided to bring this conversation to a halt. \n If Kushida heard about this, she\u2019d probably hate you. Lol. \n After I sent that message, I closed my phone. I received an immediate response but left it alone. Those guys probably wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid, and Satou likely wouldn\u2019t do anything without the others\u2019 cooperation. \n I opened my window, listening to the insects buzzing from the nearby trees. Did the kubikirigisu grasshoppers make that high-pitched chirping, I wondered? The gentle night breeze rattled my window. \n I\u2019d met Horikita on the day of the entrance ceremony. We\u2019d just so happened to be placed in the same class, and then I was assigned the seat next to hers. Before I knew it, I\u2019d become friends with Sudou and Ike. On top of that, I\u2019d been caught in the school\u2019s trap and knocked all the way down to rock bottom. Horikita had tried to help repair our situation, but her personality had ruined everything, further pushing her into isolation. Now, other people grew excited at the thought of bullying her. \n I should\u2019ve been at the center of this situation, and yet I felt like I was drifting past it. \n No, drifting\u2019s the wrong word. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant situation. I felt like I was in a haze, because I didn\u2019t know the urgency of near-expulsion. This was everyone else\u2019s problem, not mine, so it just didn\u2019t register as important. \n \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t use his innate abilities.\u201d \n Those words stuck in my head. \n \u201cA fool, huh? I wonder if that\u2019s what I am, after all.\u201d \n As I closed the window, the television\u2019s cacophonous laughter pierced my ears. \n "], "Chapter 91": ["==============="], "Chapter 92": ["8.8 \n I couldn\u2019t get to sleep, so I got up and left. I bought some juice from the lobby\u2019s vending machine and headed back for the elevator. \n \u201cHmm?\u201d \n I could see that the elevator had stopped on the seventh floor. Curious, I decided to check out the CCTV , which showed what was happening inside the elevator car. I saw Horikita, still dressed in her school uniform. \n \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really need to hide, but\u2026\u201d \n Seeing her might be awkward right now, so I hid behind the vending machine. Horikita arrived at the first floor. \n Looking wary of her surroundings, she exited the building. After she\u2019d vanished into the night, I decided to follow after her. However, I instinctively hid again after I turned the corner. \n Horikita stopped in her tracks. I sensed another person was with her. \n \u201cSuzune. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d follow me this far,\u201d he said. \n Had she left in the dead of night to rendezvous with some guy? \n \u201cHmph. I\u2019m far different from the useless girl you once knew, niisan. I came here to catch you.\u201d \n \u201cCatch me, hmm?\u201d \n Niisan? In the dark, I couldn\u2019t see the person she was talking to. Was she meeting her older brother? \n \u201cI heard you were placed in Class D. I suppose nothing has really changed in the last three years. You\u2019ve always been fixated on following me, and as a result you don\u2019t notice your own flaws. Choosing to come to this school was a mistake.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 You\u2019re wrong about that. I\u2019ll show you. I\u2019ll reach Class A right away, then\u2014\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s pointless. You will never reach Class A. In fact, your class will fall apart soon enough. Things at this school aren\u2019t as simple as you think.\u201d \n \u201cI will definitely, definitely reach\u2014\u201d \n \u201cI told you, it\u2019s pointless. You really are a disobedient little sister.\u201d \n Horikita\u2019s brother stepped closer to her. From my hiding spot, I could see him plainly. \n It was Student Council President Horikita. He displayed no hint of emotion. It was like he was staring at an uninteresting object. He grabbed his younger sister by the wrist\u2014she offered no resistance\u2014and pushed her against the wall. \n \u201cNo matter how I try to avoid you, the fact remains that you\u2019re my little sister. If people around here learned the truth, I would be humiliated. Leave this school immediately.\u201d \n \u201cI-I can\u2019t do that\u2026 I will definitely reach Class A. I\u2019ll show you!\u201d \n \u201cHow incredibly stupid. Do you want to relive the pain of the past?\u201d \n \u201cNiisan, I\u2026\u201d \n \u201cYou possess neither the abilities nor the qualities needed to reach Class A. Get that through your head.\u201d \n He moved forward, as if about to act. The situation looked fraught with danger. Resigned to facing Horikita\u2019s anger, I leapt out from my hiding space and went after her brother. \n Before he knew I was there, I grabbed his right arm, which he was using to pin his sister. \n \u201cWhat? You\u2026\u201d He stared at his arm and slowly turned to me with a sharp gleam in his eye. \n \u201cA-Ayanokouji-kun?!\u201d Horikita cried. \n \u201cYou were about to throw your sister to the ground, weren\u2019t you? You do realize the floor here is concrete, right? You might be siblings, but you should know the difference between right and wrong.\u201d \n \u201cEavesdropping is not an admirable quality,\u201d he said. \n \u201cFine. Then let go.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s my line.\u201d \n We glared at each other in complete silence. \n \u201cStop it, Ayanokouji-kun,\u201d said Horikita, her voice strained. I\u2019d never heard her voice like that before. \n Reluctantly, I released her brother. Instantly, he tried to backhand me in the face. I instinctively took a step back to avoid it. For such a lightly built guy, he was a nasty attacker. He then aimed a sharp kick at my unguarded spot. \n \u201cWatch it!\u201d \n He had enough power to knock me out with one blow. Looking slightly confused, he exhaled deeply, extended his right arm, and opened his hand. \n If I grabbed his hand, he\u2019d probably throw me to the ground. Instead, I slapped his hand away. \n "], "Chapter 93": ["==============="], "Chapter 94": [" filename=\"static\\uploads\\Classroom of the Elite - Volume 01 [Seven Seas][Kobo]\\images\\image17.jpg\"", "==============="], "Chapter 95": ["\u201cGood reflexes. I didn\u2019t imagine you could evade all of my blows so quickly. Also, you seemed to understand quite well what I was trying to do. Have you been taught?\u201d \n After the attacks stopped, the questions began. \n \u201cYes, I was taught piano and calligraphy. Also, when I was in elementary school, I won a national music competition,\u201d I said. \n \u201cYou\u2019re in Class D, too, aren\u2019t you? What a unique boy, Suzune.\u201d \n After he let go of his younger sister, he turned to face me. \n \u201cNo. Unlike Horikita, I\u2019m pretty incompetent.\u201d \n \u201cSuzune, is this boy your friend? I\u2019m honestly surprised.\u201d \n \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026not my friend. Just my classmate.\u201d Horikita faced her brother fully, as if denying him. \n \u201cYou continue to confuse independence with solitude. And you, Ayanokouji. With you around, things might get interesting.\u201d \n He walked past me and disappeared into the night. So, that was the distinguished student council president. His presence explained some of Horikita\u2019s weird behavior. \n \u201cI\u2019m going to drag myself up to Class A even if it kills me,\u201d she said. \n With her brother gone, the night was silent once more. Horikita sat up against the wall, her head hanging low. Maybe I\u2019d made things worse by getting involved. I was about to return to the dorms when Horikita called out to me. \n \u201cDid you hear everything? Or was it just a coincidence?\u201d \n \u201cOh. Uh, it was half coincidence, I\u2019d say. I saw you when I bought some juice from the vending machine. I was kind of curious, so I followed you. However, I really didn\u2019t mean to meddle in your business.\u201d \n Horikita fell silent once again. \n \u201cYour older brother is really strong. He doesn\u2019t lack ferocity.\u201d \n \u201cHe\u2019s ranked fifth dan in karate and fourth dan in aikido.\u201d \n Whew, he was really strong. If I hadn\u2019t pulled away, it would\u2019ve ended badly for me. \n \u201cYou also practice martial arts, don\u2019t you, Ayanokouji-kun? You must hold a dan rank.\u201d \n \u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I? Just piano and tea ceremony.\u201d \n \u201cYou said calligraphy before.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2026did calligraphy in addition to those, yes.\u201d \n \u201cYou purposefully get lower test scores, and you say that you studied piano and calligraphy. I really don\u2019t understand you.\u201d \n \u201cMy scores were a coincidence. I really did do piano, tea ceremony, and calligraphy.\u201d If there were a piano here, I could at least have performed \u201cF\u00fcr Elise.\u201d \n \u201cYou saw a strange side of me.\u201d \n \u201cOn the contrary, I always thought of you as a normal girl. Well, not really.\u201d \n Horikita glared at me. \n \u201cLet\u2019s go back. If anyone saw us out here, they\u2019d probably get ideas.\u201d \n She was certainly right about that. Rumors about a boy and a girl hanging out alone in the dark would be bound to circulate. Not to mention the fact that our relationship seemed to be intensifying. \n Horikita got up slowly and walked toward the dorm. \n \u201cHey. Were you really okay with how the study group went?\u201d I asked. \n If I didn\u2019t broach the subject now, I\u2019d likely never get the chance again. \n \u201cWhy are you asking me? I was the one who proposed holding the study group in the first place. Besides, I got the feeling that you considered it a hassle. Am I wrong?\u201d \n \u201cIt just left a bad taste in my mouth. Look, I think things are going to get worse with the others.\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m used to it. Besides, Hirata-kun picked up most of the failing students. He knows how to study, he seems to get along with others, and, unlike me, he\u2019ll be a good tutor. At the very least, they should all pass. It was pointless to try teaching the failing students myself. We would go through this same scenario for every test until graduation. It would be pointless to try making up for their failure every single time.\u201d \n \u201cSudou and the others don\u2019t much like Hirata. I doubt they\u2019ll participate in his study group.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s their decision, which has nothing to do with me. Besides, if they\u2019re facing expulsion, they shouldn\u2019t grumble about trivial nonsense. If they don\u2019t get closer to Hirata-kun, then they\u2019ll be expelled. Of course, my goal is to have Class D reach Class A status. However, that\u2019s for my own sake and no one else\u2019s. I don\u2019t care about anyone else. Really, if we dump the failures on this next midterm, then the better students will be left. That\u2019s what I need, correct? In that case, attaining a higher rank will be simple. Everything will work out perfectly.\u201d \n She wasn\u2019t wrong about that. Our conversation continued; Horikita was strangely talkative tonight. \n \u201cHorikita, isn\u2019t that way of thinking flawed?\u201d \n \u201cFlawed? What\u2019s flawed? You\u2019re not going to give me some gibberish about how there\u2019s no future for someone who would abandon her classmates, are you? \n \u201cRelax. I understand you well enough to know that you don\u2019t really understand me .\u201d \n \u201cThen what is it? There\u2019s no strategic advantage to helping failures.\u201d \n \u201cThere are probably very few advantages, certainly. However, it does help prevent a setback.\u201d \n \u201cDemerit?\u201d \n \u201cDo you really think that the school hasn\u2019t considered this? They\u2019ve deducted points for students arriving late or playing around during class time. Let\u2019s say these students are expelled because no one helped them. How many points do you think they\u2019ll deduct from us then?\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d she began. \n \u201cOf course, we don\u2019t have any proof that\u2019s how it works. However, isn\u2019t it possible? 100 points? 1,000 points? They might even deduct 10,000 or 100,000 points. If that happens, it\u2019ll be very difficult for you to reach Class A.\u201d \n \u201cWe\u2019ve gone down to zero points because of our infractions. We can\u2019t go any lower. If we\u2019re currently at zero, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s best to eliminate the dead weight? That would be the same as taking no damage.\u201d \n \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that\u2019d be the case. There could be penalties we just don\u2019t see yet. Do you really think it\u2019s okay to take such a dangerous risk? Well. I\u2019m sure that someone as smart as you must have thought about that already. Otherwise, you would never have suggested creating a study group in the first place. You would\u2019ve just abandoned the failures from the very beginning.\u201d \n I was starting to sound worked up, or perhaps I was actually feeling worked up. Maybe because I\u2019d started to, rather selfishly, consider her a friend. I didn\u2019t want Horikita to come to regret her decision. \n \u201cEven if there are potential unknown negatives, it\u2019s better for the future of our class to abandon the failing students. Wouldn\u2019t you regret not abandoning them when we do finally increase our points? Right now, it\u2019s a risk that we should take.\u201d \n \u201cDo you really think so?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cYes. Really. I\u2019m at a complete loss as to why you\u2019re so desperate to save them.\u201d \n As Horikita was about to board the elevator, I grabbed her wrist. \n \u201cWhat? Do you have a rebuttal?\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem\u2019s bigger than the two of us. In the end, the school has all the answers. All we can do is argue back and forth. I\u2019m free to interpret the situation as I see fit, and you may do the same. That\u2019s all there is to it, right?\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re quite talkative. I never thought you\u2019d be so loquacious.\u201d \n \u201cWhat\u2026 That\u2019s just because you were being insistent.\u201d \n If she were acting like her normal self, there was no way she would have allowed me to keep talking. Normally, stopping her in this way would earn me a sharp strike. However, her refusal to hit me indicated that Horikita felt the way I did. Of course, she probably didn\u2019t even realize it herself. \n \u201cThe day we met, do you remember what happened on the bus?\u201d \n \u201cYou mean when we refused to give up our seats to an elderly woman?\u201d \n \u201cYeah. Back then, I thought about the meaning behind giving up my seat. Should I give it up or not? Which was the correct answer?\u201d \n \u201cI already told you my own answer. I thought it\u2019d be meaningless, so I didn\u2019t give up my seat. No matter what reward it might bring, there was no real merit. It was a waste of time and effort.\u201d \n \u201cMerit, huh? I suppose that you think only in terms of gain and loss.\u201d \n \u201cIs that bad? People are calculating creatures, for the most part. If you sell goods, you receive money. If you do someone a favor, that debt of gratitude will be repaid. By giving up a seat, you gain the joy of contributing to society. Am I wrong?\u201d \n \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong. I think the same thing,\u201d I replied. \n \u201cSo then\u2014\u201d \n \u201cIf you keep to that belief, you\u2019ll need to maintain a broad perspective on life. You\u2019re so angry and dissatisfied, you can\u2019t see what\u2019s in front of you.\u201d \n \u201cWho do you think you are? Do you even have the ability to find fault with me?\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t know what abilities I have, but I see what you don\u2019t. It\u2019s the one flaw of the seemingly perfect person known as Horikita Suzune.\u201d \n Horikita gave an amused snort. It was as if she was saying, \u201cIf you think I have a flaw, say it.\u201d \n \u201cYour flaw is that you think of everyone else as a burden, and so you detach yourself and never let anyone come close. Isn\u2019t it possible they placed you in Class D because you consider yourself superior to everyone?\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re saying I\u2019m the same as Sudou-kun and his group,\u201d she muttered. \n \u201cAre you saying that you aren\u2019t equal?\u201d \n \u201cYes. It\u2019s obvious if you look at our test scores. That\u2019s proof enough that they\u2019re mere baggage for our class to carry.\u201d \n \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about studying, then Sudou and the others are certainly two or three steps behind you, Horikita. No matter how hard they worked, they likely couldn\u2019t overtake you. However, we know that this school doesn\u2019t only focus on intelligence. Suppose that the next exam was related to sports. The results would be different then. Am I wrong?\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re physically capable. From your swimming, I can tell you\u2019re one of the most capable girls in the class. Superior. However, we both know that Sudou\u2019s physical abilities far exceed yours. Ike has better communication skills than you. If the test took the form of a discussion, Ike would certainly be useful. Really, you\u2019d most likely bring the class average down. So, does that make you incompetent? No. Every individual has his or her own strengths and weaknesses. That\u2019s what it means to be human.\u201d \n Horikita tried to throw my words back at me, but she looked stuck. \n \u201cThis is all pure conjecture. It\u2019s nothing more than armchair speculation,\u201d she said. \n \u201cThink back on what Chiyabashira-sensei said. When she called us into the guidance room, she said, \u2018Who exactly decided that smart people are categorically superior?\u2019 From that, we can draw the conclusion that academic ability doesn\u2019t solely determine the rankings.\u201d \n Horikita looked around, as if searching for an escape so she could weasel her way out of the argument. I quickly cut her off before she could get away. \n \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t regret abandoning the students who failed, but you would. You would feel a great deal of regret if Sudou and the others are expelled.\u201d \n Horikita looked into my eyes. She still didn\u2019t seem to grasp our current situation. At least, that was the impression I got. \n \u201cYou\u2019re rather talkative today, too. It\u2019s odd for someone who likes to avoid trouble to talk so much.\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re probably right about that.\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, but what you said was basically correct. You\u2019ve persuaded me; I have to concede that point. However, I still don\u2019t understand you. What do you want? What is this school to you? Why did you work so hard to convince me?\u201d \n \u201cI see. So that\u2019s what you think.\u201d \n \u201cIf someone lacks persuasiveness, he or she won\u2019t be able to make others believe in their cunning theories.\u201d She clearly wanted to know why I was so desperate to persuade her that Sudou and the others\u2019 expulsion was bad. \u201cCut the crap. I want to know the real reason. Is it for points? To rise up, even by one class level? Or is it to save your friends?\u201d \n \u201cBecause I want to know what a person with true merit looks like. What is equality?\u201d \n \u201cMerit, equality\u2026\u201d \n \u201cI came to this school to find answers to those questions.\u201d The words freely spilled out of me before I could collect my thoughts. \n \u201cCould you let me go?\u201d Horikita asked. \n \u201cOh, sorry.\u201d I released my grip. She turned around and looked directly at me. \n \u201cThere\u2019s no way that you could fool me into believing you, Ayanokouji-kun,\u201d she said. \n After she said that, Horikita extended her arm. \n \u201cI\u2019ll look after Sudou-kun and the others, but for my own sake. I\u2019ll make sure that they don\u2019t get left behind, but only as a strategic means of securing an advantage for our future. Okay?\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d do it any differently. That\u2019s just like you, Horikita.\u201d \n \u201cWe\u2019ve come to an arrangement, then.\u201d \n I took Horikita\u2019s hand. However, I would soon realize that I\u2019d just made a deal with the devil. \n "], "Chapter 96": ["==============="], "Chapter 97": ["Chapter 9: The Failures Mobilize Once Again \n T he air was rich with the aroma of new tea. (I\u2019m grateful for your continued patience and cooperation, dear reader.) A month and a half had already gone by since I started high school. For the most part, my days had passed without incident. \n \u201cHey, can you hear me? Is your head okay?\u201d \n Horikita rudely smacked my forehead, then touched a hand to her own head. \n \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to have a fever,\u201d she said. \n \u201cOf course I don\u2019t! I was just lost in thought, that\u2019s all.\u201d I let out a deep sigh, already regretting that I\u2019d told Horikita I\u2019d help her. I suppose there was no use crying over spilled milk. I\u2019d offered to help as a means of encouragement, but, thinking back, it really struck me as being out of character. \n \u201cSo, my honorable tactician. What should I do, hmm?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cLet\u2019s see. Obviously, we\u2019ll need to persuade Sudou-kun and the others to participate once again. That means you\u2019ll need to grovel and beg for them to return.\u201d \n \u201cWhy should I have to do that? You\u2019re the reason the group split in the first place.\u201d \n \u201cThe reason we split was because they couldn\u2019t take studying seriously. Don\u2019t get that twisted.\u201d \n Jeez. Did she even intend to help Sudou and the others? \n \u201cWe\u2019ll never get them back without Kushida\u2019s help. You understand that, right?\u201d \n \u201cI understand. Sacrifices are inevitable,\u201d she grumbled. \n She appeared to hate the idea of Kushida\u2019s involvement. Still, she agreed despite her dissatisfaction. This was a major compromise for Horikita, who didn\u2019t want Kushida getting close to her at all. \n \u201cOkay. Can you get Kushida-san to help us immediately?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cMe?\u201d \n \u201cOf course. We made a deal. You agreed to be my workhorse until we reach Class A, so you have to do as I command.\u201d \n I didn\u2019t remember making that kind of deal. \n \u201cHere, look at this written contract.\u201d \n Wow, a real contract. It had my name and my seal on it and everything. \n \u201cYou realize they could charge you with forging documents, right?\u201d I asked. \n I tore up the contract and tossed it away. Horikita got up and went over to Kushida, who was tidying her desk. \n \u201cKushida-san. There is something I would like to talk to you about. Would you care to have lunch with me?\u201d Horikita asked. \n \u201cLunch? It\u2019s unusual to get an invitation from you, Horikita-san. Okay, I\u2019ll go.\u201d Kushida didn\u2019t waver at all. She walked with Horikita toward the school\u2019s most popular caf\u00e9, Palate. \n That was the scene of Horikita\u2019s previous anger, when I\u2019d invited her under false pretenses. Horikita said that she\u2019d treat Kushida, and paid for her drink. Of course, I had to pay for myself. \n \u201cThank you. So, what did you want to talk about?\u201d Kushida asked. \n \u201cI\u2019m putting together another study group for Sudou-kun and the others. Will you help me one more time?\u201d \n \u201cWhat\u2019s your reason for doing this? Is it really for Sudou-kun and the others?\u201d Kushida clearly understood that Horikita likely wasn\u2019t doing this out of altruism. \n \u201cNo. This is for me.\u201d \n \u201cI see. So, you look out for yourself as usual, Horikita-san.\u201d \n \u201cYou won\u2019t help someone whose motives are selfish?\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re free to think whatever you like. I just didn\u2019t want you to try to lie to me. I\u2019m glad you were honest. Okay, I\u2019ll help. We\u2019re classmates, after all. Right, Ayanokouji-kun?\u201d \n \u201cY-yeah. You\u2019re really helping us,\u201d I muttered. \n \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to ask you though, Horikita-san. You\u2019re not doing this for your friends or to get points. It\u2019s so you can get to Class A, right?\u201d \n \u201cYes.\u201d \n \u201cI can\u2019t believe that, though. I mean, isn\u2019t it impossible? Oh, I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re stupid, Horikita-san. How do I put this, though? More than half of the class has given up, you see.\u201d \n \u201cBecause the gulf between us and Class A is so vast?\u201d \n \u201cYes. To be perfectly honest, I can\u2019t imagine how we\u2019d catch up. I\u2019m not sure we can even get any points next month. It\u2019s disheartening.\u201d \n Horikita smacked the table. \u201cI\u2019m going to do it. Definitely,\u201d she said. \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun, are you aiming for Class A, too?\u201d Kushida asked. \n \u201cYes. He\u2019s working as my assistant.\u201d \n Horikita had given me a title without asking me. \n \u201cHmm. I understand. I want in, Horikita-san.\u201d \n \u201cTo help us with the study group.\u201d \n \u201cNo, not for that. I want to work on getting into Class A with you. I want to help with everything else you\u2019ll be doing.\u201d \n \u201cHuh? But\u2026\u201d \n \u201cSo, you don\u2019t want me to join?\u201d Kushida asked. \n She looked at Horikita with wide eyes, prompting her to answer. \n \u201cFine. If everything goes well with the study group, I\u2019ll accept your help moving forward,\u201d answered Horikita. \n Kushida probably had some ulterior motive. Even so, Horikita understood that she had no choice but to acknowledge Kushida\u2019s value. Having coaxed a victory from the usually stubborn Horikita, Kushida excitedly sat up. \n \u201cReally?! Yay!\u201d Kushida cheered, a look of genuine delight on her face. She looked really cute this way. \u201cI look forward to working with you again, Horikita-san! Ayanokouji-kun!\u201d \n She extended her left and right arms toward us. A bit perplexed, Horikita and I shook Kushida\u2019s hands. \n \u201cGetting Sudou-kun and the others on board again will be a problem, though,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cYeah. Considering the current state of things, it will probably be difficult,\u201d I agreed. \n \u201cWell, can you leave that to me? It\u2019s the least I can do after you\u2019ve let me join you,\u201d Kushida said. \n I felt a little overwhelmed by how quickly Horikita and Kushida were moving. \n Kushida took out her cell phone, ready to leap into action immediately. Soon after, Ike and Yamauchi arrived, looking like they were on cloud nine after receiving Kushida\u2019s invitation. As soon as they saw Horikita and me, though, they looked me square in the eye. They seemed to silently ask, Did you tell her about the chat?! I thought it\u2019d be better to keep quiet. Their guilt might help in getting them to fall in line. \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry for calling you two over. I have something to ask you, or rather, Horikita-san does.\u201d \n \u201cWh-what is it? What do you want from us?!\u201d \n What an overreaction. They backed away in fright. \n \u201cAre you two joining Hirata-kun\u2019s study group?\u201d Horikita asked. \n \u201cHuh? S-study group? No. I mean, studying\u2019s so boring, and Hirata is annoyingly popular. Besides, we planned to cram the day before. Things should work out. We\u2019ve gotten by since junior high doing exactly that.\u201d \n Yamauchi nodded at Ike\u2019s words. They were counting on an all-nighter to save them. \n \u201cThat certainly sounds like an idea you two would have. But if you do, it\u2019s highly likely you\u2019ll be expelled.\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re acting the same as usual,\u201d Sudou said, showing up. He glared at Horikita. Apparently Kushida had caught Sudou in her honey trap as well. \n \u201cYou\u2019re the one who should be worried, Sudou-kun. You don\u2019t seem to have any fear of being expelled.\u201d \n \u201cI know that. Drop it, or I\u2019ll beat the crap out of you. I\u2019m busy with basketball now, anyway. I\u2019ll be just fine if I cram before the test.\u201d \n \u201cC-calm down, Sudou. Okay?\u201d Ike was acting like he didn\u2019t know what they\u2019d said in the chat. \n \u201cSudou-kun, won\u2019t you try studying with me one more time? You might manage to squeak by if you pull an all-nighter, but if that fails, you won\u2019t be able to play basketball here anymore. Right?\u201d Horikita asked. \n \u201cWell, I\u2026I don\u2019t want any of your stupid charity. I haven\u2019t forgotten the bullshit way you spoke to me the other day. If you want me to join, I want an apology first. A completely honest one,\u201d said Sudou, displaying open hostility toward Horikita. \n Although Sudou probably realized the danger he was in, he couldn\u2019t dismiss Horikita\u2019s insults. Of course, Horikita would never give him an apology. No one could ever take pride in saying something that untrue. \n \u201cI hate you, Sudou-kun.\u201d \n \u201cWhat?!\u201d \n Instead of apologizing, she spat harsh words at Sudou, throwing fuel on the fire. \n \u201cHowever, our mutual abhorrence is trivial right now. I will teach you for my own sake. You will do your best for your own sake. Am I wrong?\u201d \n \u201cYou really want to get up to Class A, then? Even if that means inviting someone you hate, like me?\u201d he muttered. \n \u201cYes, exactly. Otherwise, why would anyone willingly involve you?\u201d \n Sudou grew more openly annoyed in response to Horikita\u2019s incredible bluntness. \n \u201cI\u2019m busy with basketball. The others on the team never take study breaks, not even before a big test. I can\u2019t fall behind everyone else by doing something as boring as studying.\u201d \n As if she\u2019d predicted Sudou\u2019s remarks, Horikita opened her notebook and showed it to him. On the page, there was a detailed schedule leading up to the test. \n \u201cDuring the last session, I noticed that style of studying didn\u2019t work for you. None of you understand the fundamental basics. For example, it would be like tossing a frog into the ocean. The frog wouldn\u2019t have any idea where to go or how to swim. Also, I understand that taking time away from your hobbies will only add to your stress. Therefore, I\u2019ve come up with a plan.\u201d \n \u201cWhat kind of sorcery did you use to come up with that? All right, tell me the plan.\u201d \n He could make time for studying and club activities. Sudou, believing such a thing to be impossible, snorted in amusement. \n \u201cThe test\u2019s two weeks from today. You\u2019ll all study every day during class like your life depends on it.\u201d \n I couldn\u2019t believe what Horikita had said. No one else could, either. \n \u201cYou three don\u2019t usually work seriously during class, do you?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cYou can\u2019t know that about us,\u201d Ike objected. \n \u201cSo, you work seriously?\u201d \n \u201cWell\u2026 No, we don\u2019t. We just sit around \u2019til class is over.\u201d \n \u201cSo, in other words, you waste six hours a day doing nothing. Rather than struggling to study for the one or two hours available after class, we\u2019re wasting a far larger and more precious period of time. We must use this time better.\u201d \n \u201cWell, certainly\u2026 Theoretically that would work, but\u2026isn\u2019t that unreasonable?\u201d \n Kushida was right to be worried. They wasted time precisely because they couldn\u2019t study normally. If they couldn\u2019t manage to discipline themselves during class, I doubted they\u2019d be able to understand the problems by themselves. \n \u201cI can\u2019t even keep up with class at all.\u201d \n \u201cI know. So we\u2019ll hold a short study session during our free time.\u201d \n With that, Horikita turned to the next page, spelling out the details of her plan. After first period, we\u2019d all meet up and discuss what we hadn\u2019t understood in the lecture. During the ten-minute break, Horikita would explain the answers to those questions. We\u2019d repeat the process over the next several periods. Of course, this wasn\u2019t as simple as it seemed. Since Sudou and the others couldn\u2019t keep up naturally, they might not be able to learn the material in such a short time. \n \u201cW-wait a minute. I\u2019m kind of confused here. Is this really going to work?\u201d Ike could tell this would be difficult. \n \u201cYeah. I mean, won\u2019t it be impossible to understand that stuff in just ten minutes of break time?\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll compile answers to every question and make them easy to understand. After that, Ayanokouji-kun, Kushida-san, and I will each teach you individually, one-on-one.\u201d \n If we used this system, we might just be able to make them understand in short blocks of time. \n \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of explaining the answers. You two can handle it, right?\u201d Horikita asked. \n \u201cBut I still don\u2019t think we can do it in that little time. Studying\u2019s so hard.\u201d \n \u201cOne class period covers surprisingly little content. Typically, there\u2019ll be one page of notes, two at the most. If you narrow it down to only the things that will be on the test, you can probably whittle it down to a half a page of information. If we somehow end up not having enough time, we can always use our lunch period. I\u2019m not saying that you have to understand the material. I just want you to memorize it. During class, you must focus on the teacher\u2019s voice and what\u2019s written on the blackboard. Forget about taking notes for right now.\u201d \n \u201cSo, you\u2019re telling us not to take notes?\u201d \n \u201cTrying to memorize things is surprisingly difficult when you\u2019re writing down notes.\u201d \n She was probably right about that. A focus on note-taking would simply waste precious time. At any rate, Horikita had laid out a plan that didn\u2019t use up any time after school. \n \u201cJust try. Give it a go before you say no.\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t want to. I\u2019d rather spend my time differently than a bookworm like you. Besides, I don\u2019t even think I could learn to study with such a simple, cheap trick.\u201d Horikita had carefully come up with a plan tailored to the three of them, and yet Sudou still wouldn\u2019t agree. \n \u201cIt seems you\u2019ve misunderstood. There are no shortcuts or cheap tricks when it comes to studying. You just have to spend your time carefully. That applies not only to studying, but to everything else as well. Or are you telling me there are shortcuts and cheap tricks in something like basketball?\u201d \n \u201cOf course there aren\u2019t. You only improve by practicing, all the time.\u201d Sudou inhaled sharply, surprised by his own words. \n \u201cFor people who can\u2019t focus or work seriously, it\u2019s impossible. However, you put all of your effort into basketball. I want you to apply some of that effort to studying, even if it\u2019s just a fraction of what you have. Put in the effort so that you can continue to play basketball at this school. Don\u2019t throw away your own potential.\u201d \n Horikita\u2019s compromise was small, but real. Sudou hesitated. However, his pride still got in the way. He seemed incapable of agreeing to the plan. \n \u201cYeah, I\u2019m still not doing it. I get what you\u2019re saying, but I\u2019m not convinced.\u201d \n Sudou made to turn around and leave, and Horikita couldn\u2019t stop him. If he left now, the study group was probably dead. Normally I\u2019d stay out of it, but this called for drastic action. \n \u201cHey, Kushida. Do you have a boyfriend?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cHuh? What? I don\u2019t. Why would you suddenly ask me something like that?!\u201d she cried. \n \u201cIf I can get fifty points on the test, will you go out with me?\u201d I extended my hand to her. \n \u201cHuh?! Wh-what are you saying, Ayanokouji! No, date me , Kushida! I\u2019ll get fifty-one points!\u201d Ike cried. \n \u201cNo, no, me! Go on a date with me! I\u2019ll show you! I\u2019ll get fifty-two points!\u201d Yamauchi said. \n Kushida immediately understood my plan. \n \u201cH-how embarrassing\u2026 I don\u2019t just judge people based on something like test scores, you know?\u201d she said. \n \u201cBut they need a prize for trying. Look at how eager Ike and Yamauchi are. They\u2019d probably be motivated by a reward.\u201d \n \u201cW-well then, how about this? I\u2019ll go on a date with whoever scores highest on the test. I like people who work really hard, even when they don\u2019t like doing it.\u201d \n \u201cWhoa! Yes! I\u2019ll do it! I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Ike and Yamauchi breathed heavily in their excitement. I called out to Sudou. \n \u201cHey, Sudou. What about you? This might be your chance.\u201d \n That was a bit subtler than yelling, Do you want to date Kushida? \n I generally understood Sudou\u2019s personality, but it was still difficult to predict whether he\u2019d agree. So I had to find some common ground. \n \u201cA date, huh? That doesn\u2019t sound too bad. Jeez, guess I don\u2019t have a choice. All right, I\u2019ll join,\u201d Sudou said, his voice small. He didn\u2019t turn around. \n Kushida sighed deeply in relief. \n \u201cRemember, boys are the simplest creatures on earth.\u201d \n Horikita probably agreed with me. We welcomed Sudou to our group. \n "], "Chapter 98": ["==============="], "Chapter 99": ["9.1 \n T he study group seemed to have gotten off to a good start. Of course, no one suddenly loved studying or found great joy in it. However, they all did their part to avoid expulsion so they could continue to spend time with their friends. The Idiot Trio started changing their behavior. They frantically repeated everything written on the blackboard, wracking their brains to understand the problems. \n Sudou occasionally came close to passing out during class. His head would bob up and down as he started to doze, but he managed to stay awake, likely because of his professional basketball dreams. Most people would laugh at such high aspirations, but he chased them earnestly. Many of the first-year students, fresh from junior high, didn\u2019t have a \u201cdream\u201d yet. Many had only the vaguest notion of what they wanted their future to be. At least Sudou was already working hard in pursuit of his dream. That was worthy of praise. \n How exactly did this school define an exemplary student? At the very least, people didn\u2019t pass or fail based solely on academics. Considering the fact that Ike and Sudou had been accepted into the school, that much was obvious. If the school enrolled students talented in other areas, though, it was odd that they\u2019d have a system in place to expel students for just one failing grade. At least, that was how I saw it. \n Unless the system itself was a lie, there wasn\u2019t much I could conclude. Could they be creating such problems for students like Ike and Sudou solely so they could overcome them? It likely wasn\u2019t that simple. Both the small test we\u2019d taken and the classes, so difficult for those like Sudou, posed problems. \n Once the afternoon class had ended, a satisfied-looking Horikita gave a small nod and glanced at her notes. Apparently, she\u2019d compiled everything together. Even though Horikita was teaching the Idiot Trio, she wanted the best possible results. That was her nature. Our class\u2019s evaluation would improve, as would the individual students\u2019 abilities. However, trying to get perfect scores was absurd. We didn\u2019t intend to reach that far. Helping Ike and the others avoid failing was the best we could do. \n When the lunch bell rang, everyone made a mad dash for the cafeteria. Our break was forty-five minutes long. After lunch, everyone had agreed to meet in the library for a twenty-minute study session. At first, we\u2019d planned to study in the classroom. However, for better concentration, we decided to avoid noise and use the library. \n However, the main reason was that Horikita wanted to avoid Hirata. His study group also met during lunch, and if we were reviewing materials nearby, they\u2019d likely try to talk to us. Horikita absolutely did not want that. \n \u201cHorikita, what are you doing for lunch?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cWell\u2014\u201d \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun! Do you want to eat lunch together? I don\u2019t have any plans today!\u201d Kushida unexpectedly hopped out in front of me. \n \u201cAh, okay. Well then, do you want to eat together with Kushida\u2014\u201d I began. \n \u201cI already have plans. Please excuse me.\u201d Horikita stood and stalked out of the classroom by herself. \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ayanokouji-kun. Was I possibly\u2026being a bother?\u201d Kushida asked. \n \u201cOh, no. Not at all.\u201d \n Kushida waved to Horikita\u2019s retreating form, as if saying, Bye bye! \n Had she planned that, by chance? After I\u2019d discovered Kushida\u2019s secret, she\u2019d been rather blatant about keeping tabs on me. Though she said that she believed me, she might still suspect I\u2019d tell someone. Kushida and I went to the caf\u00e9 to get lunch together. When we arrived, the absolute flood of women overwhelmed me. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? There\u2019re an insane number of girls here,\u201d I said. \n I\u2019d say 80 percent of the customers were girls. \n \u201cThis isn\u2019t really a place where boys come to eat.\u201d \n The menu included items like pasta and pancakes, food that only girls would like. Athletic people like Sudou would probably complain about the small portions. There were a few guys, but you could say that they were either coupled up or playboys. Every guy here was either alone with one girl or surrounded by multiple ladies. \n \u201cHow about we go to the cafeteria after all? I feel kind of uncomfortable here,\u201d I said. \n \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine once you get used to it. It seems like Kouenji-kun comes here every day. See?\u201d Kushida pointed to a table in the back, where Kouenji sat surrounded by girls. He looked just as grand and imposing as ever. I\u2019d never seen him around during lunchtime. Was this where he went? \n \u201cHe seems really popular. Those girls around him are all third years.\u201d \n Kushida was surprised, too. I overheard some of the conversation between Kouenji and the older girls. \n \u201cHere, Kouenji-kun, say \u2018Ahh!\u2019\u201d one of them said. \n \u201cHa ha! Just as I thought, more mature girls are the best.\u201d \n He certainly didn\u2019t act shy at all around the third-year ladies. Rather, he ate his food while they practically pressed up against him. \n \u201cThat guy is really something else,\u201d I muttered. \n \u201cHis name seems to be going around lately. People are talking about him.\u201d \n I see. So, were those girls after his money? \n \u201cWhat a sad world.\u201d \n \u201cThose girls are just being realists. You can\u2019t afford to eat on dreams alone,\u201d she said. \n \u201cAre you a realist, Kushida?\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019m a bit of a dreamer. Something like a knight in shining armor would be nice.\u201d \n \u201cA knight in shining armor, hmm?\u201d \n We sat as far away from Kouenji as possible. \n \u201cWhat about you, Ayanokouji-kun? Do you like girls like Horikita-san?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cWhy\u2019d you bring up Horikita?\u201d \n \u201cWell, you\u2019re always with her. Isn\u2019t she cute?\u201d \n Well, I certainly thought she was cute. On the outside, though. \n \u201cKnow something, Ayanokouji-kun? You\u2019ve caught the girls\u2019 eyes for a little while now. You\u2019re on a first-year students\u2019 ranking chart.\u201d \n \u201cCaught their eye? Me? Also, what the hell kind of ranking?\u201d \n Apparently, we men had been rated without even noticing. Was it like the ranking we\u2019d made for the girls\u2019 breast sizes? \n \u201cWell, there are lots of different rankings, you know? The hot guy rankings. The rich guy rankings. The creeper rankings. And\u2014\u201d \n \u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough. I don\u2019t think I want to hear any more.\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019re ranked a respectable fifth place in the hot guy rankings. Congratulations! By the way, Satonaka-kun in Class A is in first place. Hirata-kun\u2019s in second. The third and fourth place boys are in Class A. I feel like Hirata-kun gets lots of points because of his looks and personality.\u201d \n I\u2019d expect nothing less from the Class D star. Even girls in Class C and above noticed him. \n \u201cIs it okay for me to be happy about that?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cOf course. Oh, but you also ranked pretty high in gloominess.\u201d \n \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201d I looked at Kushida\u2019s cell phone. There really were a lot of different ranking charts. I saw a rather disturbing ranking titled, \u201cBoys Who Should Die.\u201d Better not look at that one. \n \u201cAre you not really happy about it? You\u2019re ranked fifth.\u201d \n \u201cI guess if I cared about popularity it\u2019d be different, but I don\u2019t really feel anything.\u201d Besides, no girl had ever placed a letter with a heart sticker on it in my bag. \u201cSo, does everyone participate in this?\u201d \n \u201cWell, not everyone, but lots of people do. I don\u2019t know the exact number of votes, though. The comments are also anonymous.\u201d \n In other words, many unknown variables made it difficult. \n \u201cI think you\u2019re probably at a disadvantage, Ayanokouji-kun. From my point of view, you\u2019re definitely attractive enough to be considered a hot guy, but I don\u2019t think people would say you\u2019re as beautiful or stand out as much as Hirata-kun. You\u2019re not exceptionally smart, you don\u2019t have exceptional athletic ability, and you\u2019re not a great conversationalist. There\u2019s something missing, some element of attractiveness, you know?\u201d \n In other words, there was nothing appealing about me at all. \u201cOuch. I feel like I just got stabbed in the heart.\u201d \n \u201cS-sorry. I probably should have held back a bit.\u201d Kushida appeared sheepish. \u201cHey, Ayanokouji-kun. Did you have a girlfriend in junior high school?\u201d \n \u201cWould it be bad if I didn\u2019t?\u201d \n \u201cSo, you didn\u2019t have one? Ha ha, no. No, it\u2019s not bad.\u201d \n \u201cRankings, huh? What would the girls think if the boys did something like that?\u201d \n \u201cThey\u2019d probably consider them the lowest of the low.\u201d \n Her smile didn\u2019t reach her eyes. Well, that was to be expected. If the boys ranked girls by cuteness, the girls would vehemently object. There was a definite double standard at play. At any rate, Kushida didn\u2019t seem to be treating me any differently than she had before. I\u2019d thought things might have changed since discovering her secret side. \n \u201cHey. You don\u2019t have to force yourself to talk to me if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d I said. \n \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to. Talking to you is fun, Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d \n \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you hated me, though?\u201d \n \u201cHa ha ha, yes, I did. Sorry, but that\u2019s how I really feel.\u201d \n Well, that hurt. Even though she was smiling, she hated me. This was the worst. \n \u201cTo tell you the truth, I invited you out to lunch today because I wanted to check with you. Hypothetically, if you had to choose either Horikita-san or me as your ally, whom would you choose, Ayanokouji-kun? Would you choose me?\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s ally or enemy. I\u2019m neutral.\u201d \n \u201cThere are some situations where you can\u2019t avoid trouble by staying neutral. It\u2019s wonderful to oppose war, for example, but you may find yourself in the middle of turmoil at some point, you know? If Horikita and I happen to clash, I hope that you\u2019ll cooperate with me, Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d \n \u201cWhen you say that\u2026\u201d \n \u201cAnyway, try to remember that I\u2019m expecting your help.\u201d \n \u201cExpecting, huh? If you were to ask for my help, your first priority should probably be to explain the situation.\u201d \n Kushida, still smiling, emphatically shook her head. \u201cFirst, we\u2019d need to build a relationship of mutual trust.\u201d \n \u201cI suppose.\u201d \n Neither Kushida nor I understood each other yet. Perhaps in the future, I\u2019d come to have deeper knowledge of her. \n "], "Chapter 100": ["==============="], "Chapter 101": ["9.2 \n W e gathered in the library one minute later than we\u2019d agreed. Everyone had their notebooks open, ready and waiting. The library was a popular study spot, it seemed. First through third years fought to move up in the rankings. I understood it with a glance. \n \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cSorry, the crowds were tough.\u201d \n \u201cYou two didn\u2019t eat lunch together, did you?\u201d \n Ike turned to us, his eyes suspicious. Kushida and I had actually eaten together, but perhaps it was better to keep that information private. \n \u201cYes, we did. We ate lunch together,\u201d Kushida said. \n It would have been better if she\u2019d said nothing. Sure enough, Ike and the others glared at me, their discontent plain to see. Ike looked at me like I was his ancestral enemy. Horikita spoke without glancing up. \n \u201cHurry,\u201d she said. \n \u201cOkay.\u201d \n At Horikita\u2019s cold command, I sat down and took out my notebook. \n \u201cI thought I might need more help on this, but geography is actually pretty easy.\u201d \n \u201cChemistry wasn\u2019t as hard as I thought it\u2019d be, either.\u201d \n Ike and Yamauchi sounded pleased. \n \u201cMost of the problems boil down to memorization, right? You can\u2019t solve many problems in English or mathematics if you don\u2019t understand the foundation, though.\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down. I think there might be current events questions on the test, too.\u201d \n \u201cCurrent\u2026events?\u201d \n \u201cEvents of the recent past related to politics or the economy. That means that the questions may not be limited by what\u2019s written in the textbook.\u201d \n \u201cUgh, isn\u2019t that against the rules? That means we have no idea what\u2019s going to be on the test, doesn\u2019t it?!\u201d \n \u201cSo that\u2019s why you should study everything.\u201d \n \u201cI suddenly hate geography\u2026\u201d \n While the test might cover current events, I thought it\u2019d be fine to ignore them for now. If you worried too much, you\u2019d likely miss out on something important and suffer for it. \n \u201cShouldn\u2019t we hurry it up?\u201d I asked. We were wasting precious time talking about this or that. \n \u201cYes. We\u2019ve been wasting time because someone was late.\u201d \n \u201cAre you still harping on me for that?\u201d \n \u201cHere\u2019s a question for everyone. Who came up with inductive reasoning?\u201d \n \u201cUm. It was that guy we learned about in class before, right? That was\u2026\u201d Ike wracked his brain and spun his mechanical pencil. \n \u201cOh, that\u2019s it. That one guy. His name made me super hungry.\u201d \n \u201cFrancisco Xavier! Or something like that, right?\u201d Sudou asked. \n Close, but no cigar. \n \u201cI remember! Francis Bacon!\u201d Ike cried. \n \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d \n \u201cYes! I\u2019m definitely going to get a perfect score!\u201d \n \u201cNo, not really\u2026\u201d \n If we all managed to keep up this pace for another week, everyone might just avoid failing. \n \u201cPlease be mindful of your health, everyone. If you get sick, you\u2019ll have less time to study!\u201d Kushida understood that we had no wiggle room left. \n \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Not about those three, anyway,\u201d Horikita grumbled. \n \u201cJust as I\u2019d expect from you, Horikita-chan! I feel like you\u2019re starting to have some faith in us!\u201d \n Actually, she probably meant something more like, \u201cIdiots don\u2019t catch colds.\u201d \n \u201cHey, quiet down. Your yammering is getting annoying.\u201d A nearby student turned to look at us. \n \u201cSorry, sorry. Guess I got a little carried away. I\u2019m just so happy I got something right. Did you know that Francis Bacon was the guy who came up with inductive reasoning? I won\u2019t lose points on that question!\u201d said Ike, laughing foolishly. \n \u201cHuh? Hey, could you guys be Class D students, by chance?\u201d \n A group of boys all looked over at us at once. Sudou, seemingly irritated by this, sounded mildly angry as he said, \u201cSo what? What\u2019s the big deal if we\u2019re in Class D? Do you have a problem with that?\u201d \n \u201cNo, no, there\u2019s no problem. I\u2019m Yamawaki, from FClass C. Nice to meet you.\u201d Yamawaki chuckled. \u201cI have to say, I\u2019m glad that they separate the classes in this school by ability. That way I don\u2019t have to study with losers like you.\u201d \n \u201cWhat\u2019d you say?!\u201d Sudou\u2019s anger flared. \n \u201cDon\u2019t get mad. I\u2019ve only spoken the truth. I wonder\u2026 If we happened to fight, how many points would you lose? Oh wait, you guys don\u2019t even have any points to lose, do you? In that case, you\u2019d probably be expelled, right?\u201d \n \u201cFine with me. Bring it!\u201d \n Sudou\u2019s shouting attracted attention and looks of disgust. If things got much worse, then the teacher would probably hear about it. \n \u201cHe\u2019s exactly right. We\u2019re not sure what\u2019ll happen if you create a ruckus. You should remember that you might be expelled as a worst-case scenario. I don\u2019t particularly mind that you\u2019re bad-mouthing us, but you\u2019re in Class C, right? Honestly, you shouldn\u2019t really brag about that,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cClearly there were errors of calculation in placing Class C and A. But you guys in D are on a completely different level.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s quite an inconsistent standard of measurement. The way I see it, everyone outside of Class A is lumped together.\u201d \n Yamawaki stopped laughing and now glared at Horikita. \n \u201cWow. For a defective product that can\u2019t make a single point, you\u2019re pretty sassy, aren\u2019t you? Did you think you could say whatever you like just because you have a cute face?\u201d \n \u201cThank you for your wholly incoherent and irrelevant statement. I was never very concerned about my appearance until now, but after being praised by you, I must say I feel rather uncomfortable.\u201d \n \u201cTch!\u201d Yamawaki slammed the table and stood up. \n \u201cHey. Relax. If we\u2019re the ones who start fighting, then word will get around and we\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201d The other Class C students tugged at Yamawaki\u2019s sleeves, holding him back. \n \u201cYou do know that you\u2019ll be expelled if you fail the next test, right? I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how many of you get kicked out.\u201d \n \u201cUnfortunately for you, no one from Class D will be expelled. Before you worry about us, though, perhaps you should worry about your own class. Pride cometh before the fall.\u201d \n \u201cHa ha ha! Us, fail? Don\u2019t joke around.\u201d \n \u201cWe\u2019re not studying just to avoid failing. We\u2019re studying so we can improve our test scores. Don\u2019t lump us together with you,\u201d Yamawaki said. \u201cAlso, being happy because you know who Francis Bacon is? Are you nuts? Why are you studying things that aren\u2019t even on the test?\u201d \n \u201cHuh?\u201d Horikita looked stumped. \n \u201cWait, do you guys not know what\u2019s on the test? No wonder you\u2019re called defective products.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s enough out of you.\u201d Sudou, on the verge of really losing his temper, grabbed Yamawaki by the collar. \n \u201cHey, hey! You\u2019re really going to get violent even though it\u2019ll lose you points? You\u2019re okay with that?\u201d \n \u201cWe don\u2019t have any points to lose!\u201d \n Sudou pulled his arm back. Uh oh. Was he really going to beat the crap out of this guy? I knew I should stop him. I got up, then\u2014 \n \u201cOkay, stop. Stop!\u201d \n A female student shouted at us. Sudou stopped in response. \n \u201cWhat? This doesn\u2019t involve you. Stay out of it,\u201d he said. \n \u201cDoesn\u2019t involve me? I\u2019m trying to use the library, so it does involve me. If you want to get violent, might I suggest that you do so outside?\u201d \n In response to the blonde beauty\u2019s disinterested yet logical argument, Sudou let go of Yamawaki. \n \u201cBesides, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re provoking him? If things continue like this, I\u2019d have to report it to the school. Do you want that?\u201d \n \u201cS-sorry. We don\u2019t want that, Ichinose,\u201d Yamawaki said. \n "], "Chapter 102": ["==============="], "Chapter 103": [" filename=\"static\\uploads\\Classroom of the Elite - Volume 01 [Seven Seas][Kobo]\\images\\image18.jpg\"", "==============="], "Chapter 104": ["Ichinose. I\u2019d heard that name once before. Wait\u2026 That was the Class B student who\u2019d been talking with Hoshinomiya-sensei. \n \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go. If we try studying here, we\u2019ll catch the stupid going around.\u201d \n \u201cYeah.\u201d \n With those last words, Yamawaki and his group left. \n \u201cIf you\u2019re going to study here, please act like adults. Thank you,\u201d Ichinose said. \n Watching her gallant departure, I had to nod in admiration. \n \u201cUnlike Horikita, she managed to keep everyone in line.\u201d \n \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to create chaos. I only spoke the truth.\u201d \n The truth had led to chaos, though\u2026 \n \u201cHey. He said that this question wasn\u2019t on the test, didn\u2019t he?\u201d \n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \n We exchanged looks. Chiyabashira-sensei had told us that material about the Age of Discovery would be on the test. Horikita and I had written that down. \n \u201cDoes this mean that each class gets a different test?\u201d \n \u201cThat seems unlikely. The test should be the same for everyone in the same grade.\u201d \n Horikita was right. The same fundamental problems from the five main topics should be featured on everyone\u2019s midterm. Otherwise, it\u2019d be unclear how to judge our aptitude. Had Class C learned that the test would change before anyone else? \n Or was Class D the only group being left out of the loop? We were mystified in the light of this new information. What if every class\u2019s test had different social studies questions? No\u2026 What if it wasn\u2019t just social studies? What if all the test questions were completely different? If that were the case, then we\u2019d wasted a whole week\u2019s worth of studying. \n "], "Chapter 105": ["==============="], "Chapter 106": ["9.3 \n W e dismissed the group ten minutes before our lunch break was over. We packed up and headed toward the faculty room. We needed to confirm exactly what the test would cover. \n \u201cChiyabashira-sensei, we have an urgent question.\u201d \n \u201cQuite the theatrical entrance. You surprised the other teachers,\u201d she said. \n \u201cI sincerely apologize for the sudden intrusion.\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019re in the middle of something, so please keep it brief.\u201d Chiyabashira-sensei continued to write in her notebook. \n \u201cChiyabashira-sensei, last week when you told us what material the test would cover, did you make a mistake? A little earlier today, some Class C students told us that the test\u2019s material would be different than what we were expecting.\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei listened in complete silence and didn\u2019t even bat an eyelash as Horikita spoke. Then, she put down her pen. \n \u201cThat\u2019s right. The test\u2019s topics changed last Friday. Sorry, I must\u2019ve forgotten to inform you.\u201d \n \u201cWhat?!\u201d \n She scribbled something down on a page in her notebook, tore it out, and handed it to Horikita. She\u2019d written down textbook page numbers that referred to material we\u2019d already covered in class. Most of the new material was from before we\u2019d started the group, stuff that Sudou and the others hadn\u2019t learned. \n \u201cThanks to you, Horikita-san, I was able to correct my mistake. I\u2019m grateful to all of you. That\u2019s all. Thank you.\u201d \n \u201cWait a minute, Sae-chan-sensei! Isn\u2019t it way too late for this?\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t think so. You still have one week. If you use that study time wisely, it should be easy. Right?\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei tried to shoo us out of the faculty room without the slightest hesitation. However, none of us moved. \n \u201cEven if you stay, nothing will change. You understand that, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d \n \u201cB-but, Horikita-chan! We can\u2019t just accept this!\u201d \n \u201cAs Chiyabashira-sensei said, staying would be a waste of time. Instead, we should begin studying the revised test materials.\u201d \n \u201cBut!\u201d \n Horikita turned on her heel and left the faculty room, Sudou and the others reluctantly following after her. Chiyabashira-sensei didn\u2019t even glance at us as we left. I\u2019d thought she would apologize for making such a mistake, but she didn\u2019t. If anything, I\u2019d thought that some of the other teachers might react to this incident. \n Despite the fact that this was a pretty serious mistake for a homeroom teacher to make, none of the other teachers seemed to care. Hoshinomiya-sensei was seated nearby. Our eyes met. She gave a small smile and waved hello. Well, that was something , at least. However, I didn\u2019t think that our teacher had simply forgotten to tell us what would be covered on the test. \n When I stepped into the hallway, the afternoon class bell rang. \n \u201cKushida-san. I have a small favor I want to ask you,\u201d I said. \n \u201cHmm? What is it?\u201d \n \u201cI want you to tell the rest of Class D about the changes to the test.\u201d \n With that, I handed her Chiyabashira-sensei\u2019s paper with the textbook numbers. \n \u201cThat\u2019s fine, but\u2026is it okay for me to do it?\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re the best candidate we have. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind. Besides, we can\u2019t take the test when we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be on it.\u201d \n \u201cOkay, I understand. Leave it to me. I\u2019ll tell Hirata-kun and everyone else.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019ll get ready for tomorrow. By then, I should have narrowed down everything we\u2019ll need.\u201d \n Horikita tried hard to appear calm, but I could sense her anxiety. That time we\u2019d spent studying had been squandered, and we were back to square one. Plus, we now only had one week left. \n However, our greatest concern was keeping the Idiot Trio motivated. \n \u201cHorikita. I know I\u2019ve been difficult, but I\u2019m counting on you.\u201d Sudou bowed to Horikita as he spoke those words. \u201cStarting tomorrow\u2026I\u2019ll take a break from club activities. Will that work?\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2026\u201d \n Considering that we had only one week left and time was of the essence, it was a rational decision. However, the offer so surprised Horikita that she couldn\u2019t immediately accept. \n \u201cWill that really be okay with you? It\u2019ll be a lot of work.\u201d \n \u201cStudying is a lot of work, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Grinning, Sudou patted Horikita\u2019s shoulder. \n \u201cSudou, are you serious?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cYeah. I mean, I\u2019m pissed at our homeroom teacher and those jerks in Class C now, too.\u201d \n You could call this a blessing in disguise. After being backed into a corner, Sudou had finally developed a positive attitude about studying. He probably realized if he didn\u2019t do his best, he couldn\u2019t pass the test. His declaration inspired Ike and Yamauchi. \n \u201cGuess we don\u2019t have any choice. We\u2019ll try harder, too,\u201d Ike said. \n \u201cI understand. If you\u2019re prepared, then we can work together. However, Sudou-kun\u2026\u201d Horikita coldly removed Sudou\u2019s hand from her shoulder. \u201cPlease do not touch me. If you do so again, I won\u2019t show you any mercy.\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re not cute at all, lady\u2026\u201d \n \u201cWe\u2019re definitely gonna do this!\u201d \n \u201cYeah! Me, too!\u201d \n Kushida, who also seemed motivated, stuck out her fist. \u201cCome on, Ayanokouji-kun. You do your best, too!\u201d she cried. \n \u201cHuh? No, I\u2014\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. Did you already give up on studying?\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it a little.\u201d \n \u201cYou promised you\u2019d work with me. Did you forget?\u201d asked Horikita while glaring at me. \n \u201cI\u2019m not a good teacher. People have different strengths and weaknesses, right?\u201d \n To be honest, Horikita and Kushida were better teachers than I was. I didn\u2019t consider myself really capable of tutoring others. \n \u201cYour test scores weren\u2019t that bad, were they?\u201d \n \u201cThere isn\u2019t much time left, so it might be more effective if Horikita and Kushida work together to teach those three rather than tutoring one-on-one. Also, something else is kind of bothering me.\u201d \n \u201cSomething bothering you?\u201d \n What had happened in the faculty room was far too serious for me to overlook. \n "], "Chapter 107": ["==============="], "Chapter 108": ["9.4 \n W hen lunchtime came, I jumped to my feet and headed toward the cafeteria with purposeful strides. \n \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \n Kushida had noticed me rushing out of class and followed. She popped up before me, stopping me in my tracks. \n \u201cIt\u2019s lunch. I thought I\u2019d go to the cafeteria.\u201d \n \u201cHmm. Mind if I go with you?\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t really mind. But there are a lot of other people you could ask, you know.\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s true, I do have a lot of friends to eat lunch with, but you don\u2019t have anyone, Ayanokouji-kun. Even though you\u2019d usually reach out to Horikita-san, you haven\u2019t talked to her today. The other day, didn\u2019t you say something was bothering you about what happened in the faculty room? What was it?\u201d \n Kushida, as usual, was quite observant. To be honest, I hadn\u2019t wanted to do this with anyone, but I decided that Kushida was probably fine. I\u2019d come to learn her secret by sheer coincidence. She wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid. \n \u201cI can tell you if you promise that you won\u2019t tell anyone else.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m good at keeping secrets.\u201d \n Kushida and I headed to the cafeteria together. We navigated our way through the crowd and finally reached the meal ticket machine. I bought tickets for two portions but didn\u2019t line up at the counter. Instead, I went to the side of the vending machine and looked at students perusing the menu. \n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Kushida tilted her head and looked puzzled when I began studying the machine. \n \u201cThis might answer what was bothering me.\u201d \n I continued observing students as they bought lunch sets from the ticket machine. After I\u2019d observed about twenty students, my target appeared. He purchased his meal ticket and walked to the counter with heavy, plodding footsteps. \n \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go,\u201d I said. \n \u201cHmm? Okay.\u201d \n We quickly exchanged our tickets for our meals and sat down in front of the heavy-footed student. \n \u201cUm, excuse me. Are you an upperclassman?\u201d I asked. \n \u201cHmm? Who are you?\u201d The student regarded us calmly, a look of complete disinterest on his face. \n \u201cAre you a second-year student? Third-year?\u201d \n \u201cThird-year. Let me guess, you\u2019re a first year?\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m Ayanokouji, from Class D. You\u2019re also in Class D, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with you?\u201d \n Kushida looked at me with surprise, as if asking, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d \n \u201cBecause he\u2019s limited to eating the free meals. It\u2019s not very tasty, is it?\u201d I asked. He was eating the free vegetable meal set. \n \u201cWhat do you want? You\u2019re really irritating.\u201d He took his tray and made to stand, but I stopped him. \n \u201cI want to ask you something. If you listen, I\u2019ll show you my gratitude.\u201d \n \u201cGratitude?\u201d \n The cafeteria\u2019s hustle and bustle drowned out my voice. The students were all engrossed in chatting pleasantly with their friends. \n \u201cDo you still have the problems from the midterm test from the first semester of your first year? Or, if not, do you happen to know someone from your class who does?\u201d \n \u201cDo you even understand what you\u2019re asking?\u201d he said. \n \u201cIt\u2019s not particularly strange, is it? I didn\u2019t think it was against school rules to study using old test problems.\u201d \n \u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s simple. I believed I\u2019d have the highest chance of success if I worked with someone who doesn\u2019t have any points. Honestly, that free vegetable meal doesn\u2019t look good. Of course, things would be quite different if you actually liked eating the vegetable set. What do you think?\u201d \n \u201cHow much are you going to pay?\u201d \n \u201cTen thousand points. That\u2019s as high as I\u2019ll go.\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t have the old test problems, but\u2026I know someone who does. If you want him to help you, though, you\u2019re going to need to offer at least 30,000 points. If you\u2019ve got that, you\u2019re fine.\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m afraid that 30,000 is a no-go for me. I don\u2019t have that much.\u201d \n \u201cHow much do you have?\u201d \n \u201cTwenty thousand.\u201d \n \u201cThen 20,000\u2026 no, 15,000 should do. Nothing under that.\u201d \n \u201c15,000, huh?\u201d \n \u201cIf you\u2019d go so far as to ask for old test problems from a stranger, then you must be pretty desperate, huh? Well, the school will mercilessly expel any student who gets a failing grade. None of my classmates are even here anymore.\u201d \n \u201cI see. I understand. I\u2019ll pay the 15,000 points.\u201d \n \u201cThen we have a deal. Of course, I\u2019ll have to ask you to transfer the points in advance.\u201d \n \u201cFine, but if you do anything to stab us in the back, I won\u2019t forgive you. Even if you\u2019re an upperclassman, I\u2019ll do anything and everything I can to make sure you\u2019re expelled.\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re a freak. Fine, I get it. Besides, when you transfer points, there\u2019s always a record of it. If rumor spreads that some first-year students ripped me off, it\u2019d look bad.\u201d \n \u201cAll right then. Since I\u2019m paying you 15,000 points, can you toss in a little bonus? I want to see the answers to the surprise test that we took after being admitted.\u201d \n \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll toss that in, too. I think that your concerns are pointless, though.\u201d It seemed he understood what I was after. \n \u201cThank you very much.\u201d \n After we made our deal, he quickly left. He probably didn\u2019t want to be noticed. \n \u201cHey, Ayanokouji-kun? What you did just now. Was that really okay?\u201d Kushida asked. \n \u201cIt\u2019s no problem. School rules allow point transfers, so there was no violation.\u201d \n \u201cYou might be right, but isn\u2019t getting the old test problems cheating?\u201d \n \u201cCheating? I don\u2019t think so. If the school didn\u2019t allow it, they would have outlined it in the school rules to begin with. Also, I felt more confident after seeing that third-year student. That is to say, it\u2019s not unusual for students to barter points like this.\u201d \n \u201cHuh?\u201d \n \u201cMy request didn\u2019t particularly surprise him, and he accepted quickly. This probably isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s negotiated like this. Not only did he have the answer sheet for the first-year midterm exam, but he also had the answer sheet for the mock test we took after being admitted. If he saved those, it\u2019s clear why.\u201d \n Kushida\u2019s eyes widened in shock. \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun, what you did was unexpectedly daring.\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s just a bit of insurance to prevent Sudou and the others from getting expelled.\u201d \n \u201cBut, if the old test answers are useless, then it will have been for nothing. I mean, the past test questions are old, aren\u2019t they? They might be completely unrelated to what\u2019s featured on this year\u2019s test.\u201d \n \u201cThe problems may not be exactly the same, but there will definitely be similarities. I noticed a hint on that last mock exam we took.\u201d \n \u201cA hint?\u201d \n \u201cYou noticed the really difficult problems alongside the simple ones, right?\u201d \n \u201cYeah, I did. The final questions, right? I didn\u2019t understand them at all.\u201d \n \u201cI did some investigating, and I found that those questions were on the second- and third-year students\u2019 tests. In other words, a first-year student generally wouldn\u2019t understand how to solve them. Wouldn\u2019t it be pointless for the school to purposefully throw us problems we can\u2019t solve? Those questions aren\u2019t there simply to measure our academic ability. Now, suppose that the problems on the mock test we took were exactly the same as the problems on the old mock test. What would happen?\u201d \n \u201cIf I\u2019d seen the old test, I would have been able to answer every question,\u201d she said. \n The same thing would likely apply to the midterm exam as well. Shortly thereafter, that third-year student sent me a message with an image file attached. It was the old test questions. \n First, I checked the mock test. The key was whether or not the last three problems were the same. Kushida must have been curious as well, because she drew closer and tried to peek at my phone. \n \u201cWell? Well?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cThey\u2019re the same. Every single word is identical. The test from that year and this year are exactly the same, in every way.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s amazing! So, if we show this to everyone in class, that would mean an easy victory! We should show this to all of our other friends, not just Sudou-kun!\u201d \n \u201cNo, we\u2019ll hold off. We won\u2019t show it to Sudou and the guys yet.\u201d \n \u201cWh-why? You went to all of the trouble of using up so many of your points for this!\u201d \n \u201cIf they learn that the old test questions would be effective, their motivation to study would go up in smoke. We need to be wary of overconfidence. After all, even though the mock tests were identical, it\u2019s possible that the questions featured on the midterm this year might not be the same as last year\u2019s.\u201d \n These old test papers were insurance. \n \u201cOkay, then how will you use them?\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m going to release them on the internet the day before the test. We tell everyone that the problems from the old test are generally the same as the ones on the new. Then what do you think will happen?\u201d \n \u201cThat night, everyone will be hunched over their desks, frantically trying to memorize all of the problems!\u201d \n \u201cExactly.\u201d \n The students with a poor grasp of the basics probably wouldn\u2019t be able to memorize everything in a single day. However, we weren\u2019t shooting for perfect scores this time around. The crucial thing was to avoid failing. If we got greedy, we might end up digging our own graves. \n With this plan, we could probably get everyone in Class D to pass. \n \u201cWhen did you come up with the idea to get the old tests?\u201d she asked. \n \u201cI considered it when we learned that the test material was going to be different. However, I had a hunch back when they first told us about the midterm exam.\u201d \n \u201cHuh?! Way back then?\u201d \n \u201cThere was something very peculiar about the way Chiyabashira-sensei told us about the test. As our homeroom teacher, she had a clear understanding of everyone\u2019s grades and academic performance. Despite that, she seemed absolutely certain when she told us that there was a way for us to pass this test. In other words, she indicated that there was a surefire way for us to save everyone.\u201d \n \u201cAnd that\u2019s\u2026the old test papers?\u201d \n \u201cThis might be related to why Sudou, Ike, and Yamauchi were admitted to this school despite being academically poor. Even if they couldn\u2019t get good grades by studying ahead, perhaps there were other means of addressing the problem, a backup plan they could use to avoid expulsion. This meant that it was possible for anyone to get a near-perfect score if they could get the old test papers. That\u2019s what I took from the situation, anyway.\u201d \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun, you really are an incredibly observant person, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m just cunning. Besides, I didn\u2019t believe that I could pass the midterm without some help. I was just looking to make things easier for myself.\u201d \n \u201cHmm.\u201d Kushida grinned like some gears were turning in her mind. \n \u201cI have one more favor to ask. Could you please tell everyone that you got the old test papers, Kushida? I want you to say that you got them from a third-year student you\u2019re close to.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s fine, but\u2026are you okay with that, Ayanokouji-kun?\u201d \n \u201cI like to avoid trouble. I don\u2019t want to stand out. Besides, our classmates trust you, Kushida. I think it would be better if you told them.\u201d \n \u201cI understand. If you say so, Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d \n \u201cThanks. Don\u2019t say anything else, though. We need to avoid drawing too much attention.\u201d \n \u201cOkay, we can keep this secret between us.\u201d \n \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I was thinking.\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t you feel that a strange bond of mutual trust forms between people who share a secret?\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I sure hope so.\u201d \n \u201cThank you,\u201d replied Kushida. \n I didn\u2019t really know what she meant by that. \n "], "Chapter 109": ["==============="], "Chapter 110": ["Chapter 10: Midterm Exam \n I t was Thursday. Tomorrow, the midterm would be upon us. Class had ended for the day. After Chiyabashira-sensei ended the homeroom period and left the classroom, Kushida immediately leapt into action. She took out printed copies of the old test that I\u2019d made at the convenience store and brought them up to the podium. \n \u201cEveryone, before you return to the dorm, would you mind listening to me for a moment?\u201d \n Everyone, including Sudou, stopped and listened to Kushida. This was a role that neither Horikita nor I could play. Only Kushida could do it. \n \u201cI know that you\u2019ve all been studying a lot in preparation for the test tomorrow. I have something to help you. I\u2019m going to hand out some papers.\u201d \n Kushida distributed the question and answer sheets to the students in the first row. \n \u201cTest\u2026questions? Did you make these, Kushida-san?\u201d Horikita was visibly surprised by this sudden turn of events. \n \u201cActually, these are the old test problems. I got them from a third-year student last night.\u201d \n \u201cOld test problems? Huh? Wait, will these questions be on the test tomorrow?\u201d \n \u201cYes. To tell you the truth, I heard that the midterm test from the year before last had almost exactly the same problems as this one. So, if we study what\u2019s on this test, it\u2019ll surely come in handy.\u201d \n \u201cWhoa! Seriously? Thank you, Kushida-chan!\u201d Overjoyed, Ike hugged his test paper. None of the other students could suppress their elation, either. \n \u201cWhat the hell? If we had these , then wasn\u2019t it pointless to study so hard?\u201d Yamauchi complained, even as he laughed. \n It looked like I\u2019d been right. \n \u201cSudou-kun, do your best when you study today!\u201d \n \u201cYeah. Thanks, you really helped me out.\u201d Sudou also happily accepted the test papers. \n \u201cLet\u2019s keep this a secret from the other classes! Don\u2019t be scared, everyone! Do your best and aim for a high score!\u201d Ike shouted with joy and determination. I was inclined to agree with him. We didn\u2019t need to send supplies to the enemy. Everyone returned to the dorms with high spirits. \n \u201cKushida-san. Excellent work.\u201d Horikita gave Kushida genuine praise, which was unusual. \n \u201cEh, really?\u201d Kushida said. \n \u201cI\u2019d never even considered trying to use the old tests. I\u2019m also grateful that you verified that the questions were still useful.\u201d \n True. The always-solitary Horikita hadn\u2019t come up with that idea. \n \u201cI just did it for my friends. It was nothing special,\u201d Kushida said. \n \u201cAlso, I think that you were correct to announce that you had it today after class. If you\u2019d carelessly let word get out about this test, it\u2019s possible that everyone would have lost their motivation to study.\u201d \n \u201cThat was only because I received the test papers so late. If many of the same problems are featured on the test tomorrow, then everyone will probably manage to get pretty high test scores.\u201d \n \u201cYes. It also means that the last two weeks we spent studying weren\u2019t for nothing.\u201d \n The past two weeks had probably been tremendously long for Sudou and the other failing students. Hopefully they\u2019d gotten more into the habit of studying now. \n \u201cIt was hard but fun.\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t think the Idiot Trio found it the least bit fun.\u201d \n Well, we\u2019d done as much as we could. The next step for those three simply came down to effort. \n \u201cI just pray that I don\u2019t draw a complete blank during the actual test.\u201d \n Well, I couldn\u2019t really do anything about that part. No matter how much they were taught and what they demonstrated during the study group, everything came down to their performance on the actual test. At least the previous questions were one crucial bit of help. \n \u201cWell, should we head back?\u201d \n Horikita quietly looked over at Kushida as she put her textbook into her bag. \u201cKushida-san.\u201d \n \u201cHmm?\u201d \n \u201cReally, thank you for everything you\u2019ve done. If you weren\u2019t here, the study group would not have succeeded.\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I just want to get into the higher-ranked classes together with everyone else. That\u2019s why I did it, and why I agreed to help with the study group. I\u2019ll help you again any time.\u201d Smiling, Kushida grabbed her bag and stood. \n \u201cWait. There\u2019s just one thing I want to confirm,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cConfirm?\u201d \n \u201cIf you say that you\u2019ll continue working with me for the sake of our class, then I need to be sure of something.\u201d \n Horikita looked straight at Kushida, who was still wearing that dazzling smile. \n \u201cYou hate me, don\u2019t you?\u201d \n \u201cHey, hey\u2026\u201d I\u2019d wondered what she wanted to ask, but that was ridiculously unexpected. \n \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d Kushida asked. \n \u201cYou\u2019re not answering my question because it\u2019s true. Right?\u201d \n \u201cHa ha, you got me.\u201d She shouldered her bag and lowered her hands. Kushida faced Horikita without losing her smile. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I really hate you.\u201d \n She answered clearly, making no attempt to hide it. She was direct. \n \u201cDo you want me to tell you the reason?\u201d \n \u201cNo. That\u2019s unnecessary. Knowing that is good enough. I can continue working with you without hesitation.\u201d \n Despite what she\u2019d just been told, Horikita spoke calmly. \n "], "Chapter 111": ["==============="], "Chapter 112": ["10.1 \n \u201cT here are no absences today. It appears everyone is present.\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei strode through the classroom with a bold smile on her face. \n \u201cThat\u2019s the first hurdle for you leftovers. Are there any questions?\u201d \n \u201cWe\u2019ve studied diligently these past few weeks. I don\u2019t think that anyone will fail.\u201d \n \u201cOh my. You sound quite confident, Hirata.\u201d \n Everyone wore a confident look. The teacher promptly took up the test papers and passed them out. Our first period test was for social studies. Out of everything we\u2019d studied, it was probably the easiest subject. \n \u201cIf anyone stumbles here, the other tests will be an uphill battle, quite frankly. You\u2019ll take this midterm and the final exam in July. If no one fails either test, you\u2019ll be rewarded with a vacation during your summer break.\u201d \n \u201cA vacation?\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s right. A dream vacation on an island surrounded by the brilliant blue sea.\u201d \n Of course, the beach in summer meant we\u2019d be able to see the girls in their swimsuits\u2026 \n \u201cWh-what is this strange pressure\u2026\u201d one of the boys muttered. \n Chiyabashira-sensei stepped back from the obvious tension the students exuded\u2026 mostly the boys. \n \u201cEveryone. Let\u2019s do our best!\u201d \n \u201cYeah!\u201d Ike howled along with our classmates. I shouted too, my voice getting lost in the cacophony. \n \u201cPervert.\u201d Horikita glanced at me. I immediately fell silent. \n Before long, everyone had their test papers. On the teacher\u2019s signal, everyone began. I held off on starting for a moment and looked around at the others. With everything they\u2019d learned, could the Idiot Trio avoid failing? First off, how many of this test\u2019s questions were the same as the ones from the old exam? I needed to check that first. \n All right. \n I discreetly clenched my fist in triumph. Despite my fears, the questions here were the same as the old ones. I hadn\u2019t looked them over in any detail, but I saw no great difference. If I\u2019d memorized what was on the old test, it was clear that I could get a near-perfect score. \n Glancing around the classroom for assurance, I didn\u2019t notice any students looking flustered or confused. I assumed that many of them had engaged in some last-minute studying. Slowly, I went through and answered all of the problems. \n The second and third period exams were for Japanese and chemistry, respectively. While I worked, I discovered something else that intrigued me. Looking over the problems again, I realized that what Horikita had drilled into the study group was consistent with what was on the test. She\u2019d been able to accurately predict what problems would appear just from the lessons. The silent girl beside me was even more impressive than I\u2019d imagined. \n Then came fourth period. Mathematics. All of the abnormally difficult questions that had been featured on the mock test also appeared here, but the content was the same as the old exams. Even if Sudou and the other guys couldn\u2019t understand the problems, they could still apply the answers if they\u2019d memorized them. \n Then came the break. \n Some members of our study group, including Ike, Yamauchi, Kushida, Horikita, and myself, gathered together. \n \u201cAn easy victory! We\u2019ve got this test on lock!\u201d \n \u201cI feel like I might get 120 points.\u201d Ike sounded pretty sure of himself. Yamauchi must have felt the same, judging from the smile on his face. Confident, they looked over the old test papers for a final review. \n \u201cSudou-kun, how about you?\u201d Kushida spoke to Sudou, who sat alone at his desk and stared fixedly at the old test material. However, Sudou looked sullen. \n \u201cSudou-kun?\u201d \n \u201cHuh? Oh, sorry. I\u2019m kind of busy.\u201d \n He didn\u2019t look up from the questions as he spoke. He was reviewing the English test material, his forehead covered in a thin layer of sweat. \n \u201cSudou, did you\u2026not study the old test material, by chance?\u201d \n \u201cEverything but English. I fell asleep partway through.\u201d Sudou sounded irritated. In other words, this was his first time reviewing the material. \n \u201cEh?!\u201d \n That also meant that Sudou only had ten minutes to review. \n \u201cDamn, I can\u2019t get any of these answers to stick in my head,\u201d he muttered. \n Unlike the other tests, the English problems weren\u2019t easy to memorize. Trying to cram all of the answers in just ten minutes would be impossible. \n \u201cSudou-kun, memorize the problems that are worth a lot of points and those with the shortest answers.\u201d Horikita leapt up from her seat and moved next to Sudou. \n \u201cO-okay.\u201d He stopped focusing on the low-point questions and instead zeroed in on what would net him the most points. \n \u201cA-are you going to be okay?\u201d While trying to avoid getting in the way, Kushida appeared anxious. \n \u201cUnlike Japanese, I don\u2019t know the basics of English. These letters look like some kind of magic spell or something. Memorizing it\u2019ll take time.\u201d \n \u201cY-yeah. I struggle with English, too\u2026\u201d \n The break passed in the blink of an eye, and the heartless class bell rang. \n \u201cI did all I could. I\u2019ll try to answer the questions I remember first, before I forget them.\u201d \n \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d \n And thus began our English test. While the other students calmly made their way through, Sudou clearly had trouble. Occasionally, he\u2019d stop writing and whack his pen against his head. However, no one could help him now. Whether Sudou sank or swam was entirely up to him. \n "], "Chapter 113": ["==============="], "Chapter 114": ["10.2 \n A fter the last test, we gathered around Sudou\u2019s desk again. \n \u201cHey, did you do okay?\u201d asked Ike, anxiously. \n Sudou was on the verge of losing his cool. \n \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I did everything I could, but I have no idea how well I did\u2026\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You studied as hard as you could. I\u2019m sure you did well.\u201d \n \u201cDamn it, why did I fall asleep?\u201d Sudou fidgeted, clearly frustrated with himself. Horikita then stepped in front of him. \n \u201cSudou-kun.\u201d \n \u201cWhat is it? Are you going to lecture me again?\u201d he grumbled. \n \u201cIt was certainly your fault for not reviewing the old test\u2019s final section. However, as you said, you did everything that you could with the time that you had. You didn\u2019t cut any corners or give up. Considering how much effort you put in, I think you should hold your head high and feel proud.\u201d \n \u201cWhat is this? Are you trying to comfort me?\u201d \n \u201cComfort? I\u2019m speaking the truth. When I look at how far you\u2019ve come, I understand how hard studying is for you, Sudou.\u201d \n Horikita was genuinely praising him. None of us could believe what we were seeing. \n \u201cLet\u2019s wait for the results.\u201d \n \u201cYeah\u2026 Okay.\u201d \n \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026one more thing. Something I need to amend.\u201d \n \u201cAmend?\u201d \n \u201cEarlier, I said that your dreams of becoming a professional basketball player were foolish.\u201d \n \u201cWhy are you reminding me of that?\u201d \n \u201cI researched how someone could become a professional basketball player, and I learned that the road to success is an incredibly rocky one.\u201d \n \u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me to give up because it\u2019s a reckless dream?\u201d \n \u201cNot at all. I know that you\u2019re passionate about basketball. I also realize that you probably understand how difficult it is to play professionally.\u201d Horikita still acted in her normal, aloof manner, but this was clearly an apology, albeit an awkward one. \u201cThere are many Japanese people who fight to enter that profession. There are some among those who wish to become internationally renowned. You\u2019re one of those people, right?\u201d \n \u201cYeah. I\u2019m incredibly stupid, but I want to play ball. Even if I have to live a pathetic, miserable life as a part-time worker or worse, I\u2019m going to achieve my dream.\u201d \n \u201cI never thought I needed to understand anyone except for myself. So when you first told me that you wanted to play basketball, I insulted you. However, I now regret that. Someone who doesn\u2019t understand how difficult, how arduous basketball is has no right to dismiss that dream as foolish. Sudou-kun, don\u2019t forget the hard work and effort that you poured into studying. Apply that diligence to basketball. If you do, you might be able to go pro. At least, that\u2019s how I feel.\u201d \n Horikita\u2019s expression was the same as always, but she bowed her head to Sudou. \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I said back then. Well. Now that I\u2019ve said my piece, I\u2019ll be going.\u201d \n Horikita left the room, her apology still hanging in the air. \n \u201cHey, did you just see that? Horikita apologized! And so nicely!\u201d \n \u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d \n Ike and Yamauchi were both completely stunned. I was pretty surprised, too. Kushida was as well. Horikita had acknowledged that Sudou had done his best. A dumbfounded Sudou, still seated at his desk, looked after Horikita as she walked through the classroom door. Soon after, Sudou, put his right hand over his heart and looked at us. \n \u201cO-oh, no\u2026 I\u2026 I think I might be in love with Horikita\u2026\u201d he said. \n "], "Chapter 115": ["==============="], "Chapter 116": ["Chapter 11: The Beginning \n C hiyabashira-sensei strode into the classroom, looking around at the students in surprise. Everyone was clearly anxious, holding their breath in anticipation of the test results. \n \u201cSensei. We were told that the results would be announced today, but when?\u201d \n \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to get so worked up, Hirata. You should have passed quite easily.\u201d \n \u201cSo, when will the results be released?\u201d \n \u201cWell, if you\u2019d like, now is as good a time as any. If we waited to do it after class, we wouldn\u2019t have enough time for other procedures.\u201d \n Some of the students visibly reacted to the words \u201cother procedures.\u201d \n \u201cWhat\u2026do you mean by that?\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t get flustered. I\u2019ll tell you now.\u201d \n As usual, she revealed the details simultaneously and collectively. She stuck a large, white sheet of paper with everyone\u2019s names and test scores onto the blackboard. \n \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m impressed. I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d score so well. Many students tied with perfect scores in mathematics, Japanese, and social studies. More than ten of you, actually.\u201d \n Some of the students shouted in joy and delight when they saw the 100s lined up on the results sheet. However, some weren\u2019t smiling. The only grade that truly mattered was Sudou\u2019s score in English. \n Then\u2014 \n We saw Sudou\u2019s test scores. He had scored sixty points in four of the five main subjects, which was considerably high. He\u2019d scored thirty-nine points in English. \n \u201cYes!\u201d Sudou leapt up and shouted with joy. Ike and Yamauchi stood and cheered, too. There was no red line to be found on the results sheet. Kushida and I shared a glance and sighed in relief. Horikita didn\u2019t smile or cheer, but she did appear relieved. \n \u201cWe showed you, sensei! When we really try our best, we can do anything!\u201d Ike wore a smug, confident look. \n \u201cYes, I recognize that. You all did very well. However\u2014\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei held a red pen in her hand. \n Sudou unintentionally let out a \u201cHuh?\u201d \n She drew a red line right above Sudou\u2019s name. \n \u201cWh-what is that? What does that mean?\u201d \n \u201cYou failed, Sudou.\u201d \n \u201cHuh? You\u2019re lying, right? Don\u2019t give me that crap! Why did I fail?\u201d he cried. \n Of course, Sudou was the first one to protest this. In response to Sudou\u2019s failing grade, the entire classroom did a complete one-eighty. We stopped our delighted cheering and erupted in confusion. \n \u201cSudou, you failed the English exam. That\u2019s all.\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t screw with me! I got thirty-two points! I passed!\u201d \n \u201cWhen did anyone say that thirty-two points was a passing grade?\u201d \n \u201cNo, no. You said so, sensei! Right, everyone?\u201d shouted Ike. \n \u201cSay whatever you want, it won\u2019t matter. This is the undeniable truth. You had to score at least a forty to pass the midterm exam. In other words, you were just one point short. You were so close.\u201d \n \u201cF-forty?! You never told us about this! I won\u2019t accept it!\u201d \n \u201cShould I tell you how we determine the passing grade?\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei wrote a simple formula on the blackboard: 79.6 divided by 2 equals 39.8. \n \u201cWe set a passing grade for each individual class, just as we did for the last test. We calculated that number by dividing the average score by two. That\u2019s how we arrived at our answer.\u201d \n In other words, anything at 39.8 or lower was considered failing. \n \u201cI provided proof that you failed. That is all.\u201d \n \u201cNo way\u2026 So\u2026 Does that mean I\u2019m going to be expelled?\u201d \n \u201cAlthough your time here was short, you struggled valiantly. You\u2019ll be asked to fill out a withdrawal form after class, but you will need to have a legal guardian present when you do so. I\u2019ll contact them for you.\u201d \n As we witnessed the scene unfold, the teacher rattling off the information as if she were casually giving a report, we finally realized that this was actually happening. \n \u201cAs for the rest of you, good work. You all passed without any issues. Work hard so that you can pass your final exam as well. Well then, next\u2014\u201d \n \u201cS-sensei. Is Sudou-kun really being expelled? Is there no way to save him?\u201d \n Hirata was the first to show concern, even though Sudou hated him and had lashed out at him verbally. \n \u201cHe\u2019s being expelled. He got a failing grade.\u201d \n \u201cCould we possibly see Sudou-kun\u2019s answer sheet?\u201d \n \u201cEven if you look it over, you won\u2019t find any grading mistakes. I was expecting that you\u2019d protest.\u201d \n She took out Sudou\u2019s English answer sheet and handed it to Hirata, who immediately looked over every problem. His expression turned dark when he reached the end. \n \u201cThere\u2026are no mistakes.\u201d \n \u201cWell, if you\u2019re all in agreement, homeroom is over.\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei had heartlessly announced Sudou\u2019s expulsion without offering him a second chance or the faintest bit of sympathy. Ike and Yamauchi, knowing that words of comfort would probably have the opposite effect, stayed silent. Hirata remained quiet, too. Sadly, some of the students appeared relieved by this. Were they happy that a nuisance like Sudou was being removed from the class? \n \u201cSudou, come to the faculty room after class. That is all.\u201d \n \u201cChiyabashira-sensei. May I have a moment of your time?\u201d \n Though she\u2019d stayed silent until that moment, Horikita raised her slender arm in the air and spoke. Thus far, Horikita had never voluntarily made any remarks. Chiyabashira-sensei and the rest of the class appeared shocked by this abnormality. \n \u201cWell, this is unusual, Horikita. Why?\u201d \n \u201cEarlier, you said that the previous test had a passing grade of thirty-two points. You arrived at that number by the same formula you showed us today. Were there no mistakes in calculating the passing grade for the last test?\u201d \n \u201cThere were no mistakes.\u201d \n \u201cThen, that raises one more question. I\u2019d calculated the average score for the previous test to be 64.4 points. If I were to divide that by two, I would get 32.2 points. In other words, higher than 32 points. Despite that, the passing grade was set at 32. That means that you left off the decimal. That contradicts what you did this time.\u201d \n \u201cTh-that\u2019s right. If you follow what you did last time, the passing grade for the midterm should be thirty-nine points!\u201d \n In other words, Sudou\u2019s overall grade should have meant that he just barely passed. \n \u201cI see. Did you anticipate that Sudou would just barely pass, then? You only scored exceedingly low in English, after all.\u201d \n \u201cHorikita, you\u2026\u201d \n Sudou had realized something. The other students gasped as they also realized what had happened. Horikita had gotten perfect scores in four of the five main subjects, but she\u2019d gotten an exceedingly low score of fifty-one points in English. Her English stuck out from her other scores. \n \u201cYou really\u2014\u201d \n Sudou noticed what she\u2019d done. In order to lower the average score for the English test, Horikita had purposefully botched her own grade as far as she could. \n \u201cIf you believe that my thinking is incorrect, could you please tell why the calculation differs between this test and the last test?\u201d she asked. \n The last ray of light. Our final hope. \n \u201cI see. In that case, I\u2019ll explain in more detail. Unfortunately, your calculation is off. We didn\u2019t simply omit the decimal when we calculated the passing grade. We rounded the numbers up or down. On the last test, we rounded down to thirty-two points, and on this, we rounded up to forty. There\u2019s your answer.\u201d \n \u201cTch\u2026\u201d \n \u201cYou should have noticed that we rounded the numbers, but to hold on to that possibility\u2026 Well, too bad. At any rate, first period will be starting soon. I\u2019ll be going.\u201d \n Horikita had nothing left to counter with, so she remained quiet. She couldn\u2019t contradict anything Chiyabashira-sensei had said. Horikita\u2019s last resort had been eradicated. The classroom door slammed shut, and silence enveloped the room. \n Sudou, still struggling to wrap his head around this new reality, looked over at Horikita. She had purposefully lowered her grades as far as she could, all to stop Sudou\u2019s expulsion. \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have tried to lower my score just a little more,\u201d she muttered. \n Horikita slowly sat back down. However, Horikita\u2019s 51-point score on her English test was already considerably low. If she\u2019d scored in the 40-point range, she could have run the risk of expulsion herself. \n \u201cWhy? You said that you hated me,\u201d Sudou said. \n \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. I did this for my own sake. It was all for nothing, though.\u201d \n I slowly got up from my seat. \n \u201cWh-where are you going, Ayanokouji?\u201d \n \u201cBathroom.\u201d \n With that, I exited and quickly made my way toward the faculty room. I wondered if Chiyabashira-sensei had already arrived. As I thought that, I caught her staring out the window into the first-floor hallway, almost as if she were waiting for someone. \n \u201cAyanokouji, hmm? Class will begin any minute, you know,\u201d she said. \n \u201cSensei. Would it be all right if I asked you one question?\u201d \n \u201cOne question? Is that why you went to the trouble of chasing after me?\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m curious about something.\u201d \n \u201cFirst it was Horikita, now you. What in the world is it?\u201d \n \u201cDo you think that today\u2019s Japanese society is fair?\u201d \n \u201cWhat an incredible change in topic. So sudden, too. Is there some special meaning behind this question?\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s very important. I would like your opinion.\u201d \n \u201cIf you\u2019re asking for my personal opinion, then, no, of course not. The world isn\u2019t fair, not even the slightest bit.\u201d \n \u201cI see. I feel the same way. I think that equality is a fiction.\u201d \n \u201cSo, did you chase after me merely to ask that question? If that\u2019s all, then I\u2019ll be going.\u201d \n \u201cOne week ago, when you told us that the test\u2019s material had changed, you also said something like \u2018I forgot to inform you.\u2019 Because of that forgetfulness, we were notified of the change one week after the other classes had already been informed.\u201d \n \u201cYes, I said as much back in the faculty room. What of it?\u201d \n \u201cEvery class got the same questions, the points were reflected in the same way for everyone, and every class faced the same threat of expulsion. However, Class D was compelled to test under unfair conditions.\u201d \n \u201cAre you saying that you can\u2019t accept what happened? But it\u2019s an excellent example of how unfair the world is. In fact, you could call it a microcosm of our unfair society.\u201d \n \u201cCertainly, society is not equal, no matter how idealistic you try to be. However, we are human beings, living things that can think.\u201d \n \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d \n \u201cI\u2019m saying that we should strive for equality. At least a little.\u201d \n \u201cI see.\u201d \n \u201cWhether or not you truly forgot to tell us, or if it was an intentional slip, isn\u2019t really the issue. The fact remains that one person is now being expelled from this school because of those unfair conditions.\u201d \n \u201cSo, what do you want me to do?\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I would like to undertake the appropriate steps to meet with the school, the direct cause of this inequality.\u201d \n \u201cTo tell them you disagree?\u201d \n \u201cI just want to confirm with the appropriate people that they believe the school made the correct judgment.\u201d \n \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. What you\u2019ve said isn\u2019t wrong, but I can\u2019t allow you to do that. Sudou will be expelled. That decision cannot be overturned at this stage. Give up.\u201d \n She\u2019d ignored my point, but her words remained logical. As I\u2019d anticipated, her words always held some hidden meaning. \n \u201cYou said it \u2018cannot be overturned at this stage.\u2019 Which means there may be a way to overturn the decision.\u201d \n \u201cAyanokouji, I personally hold you in rather high regard. I\u2019ve thought so since assigning this test. Obtaining the old test problems was certainly one correct solution. Such a notion goes beyond the range of what many would have considered. Furthermore, you distributed the old test problems to everyone in class and raised the average scores. I have to praise such a logical decision. Honestly, you did very well.\u201d \n \u201cKushida was the one who obtained the problems and distributed them. I didn\u2019t really do anything.\u201d \n \u201cI understand why you don\u2019t want word to get out, but don\u2019t forget that there are senior students, too. I already know that you contacted a third-year student.\u201d \n Apparently, my actions were more conspicuous than I\u2019d thought. \n \u201cHowever, despite your bold move in obtaining those questions, you made a mistake in the end. That\u2019s why your plan failed. If Sudou had memorized the material more thoroughly, he wouldn\u2019t have failed in any subject, right? Honestly, why don\u2019t you just give up and let Sudou get tossed out? Wouldn\u2019t things be easier in the future?\u201d \n \u201cHonestly, you\u2019re probably right. However, I decided to lend a hand. I suppose it\u2019s too early for me to give up. I\u2019ve one thing left to try.\u201d \n I took my student ID card out of my pocket. \n \u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d \n \u201cPlease sell me one point that I can apply to Sudou\u2019s English test.\u201d \n \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei\u2019s eyes widened, and then she laughed loudly. \n \u201cHa ha ha ha ha! That\u2019s a rather interesting idea. You really are a different kind of student. I never imagined you\u2019d try to buy points.\u201d \n \u201cYou said so the day we were admitted, didn\u2019t you, sensei? You said that we can buy anything with our points. The midterm test is just one more \u2018thing\u2019 at this school, after all.\u201d \n \u201cI see, I see. You certainly could view it that way. However, do you even have enough money on hand to afford it?\u201d \n \u201cWell, how much does one test point cost?\u201d \n \u201cNow, that\u2019s a rather difficult question, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve never been asked to sell test points before. Let\u2019s see\u2026 Seeing as how this is a special occasion, I\u2019ll sell a test point for the exceptional price of 100,000 points.\u201d \n \u201cYou\u2019re cruel, sensei.\u201d \n Everyone at this school had spent at least some of their points. Absolutely no one had 100,000 to spare. \n \u201cI\u2019ll pay, too,\u201d someone said behind me. When I turned, I found Horikita standing there. \n \u201cHorikita\u2026\u201d I said. \n \u201cHeh. Just as I thought. You two are interesting.\u201d \n Chiyabashira-sensei took my student ID card. Then she took Horikita\u2019s. \n \u201cFine. I accept your deal. I\u2019ll sell you one point to apply to Sudou\u2019s test, taking a combined total of 100,000 points from you both. As for the matter of Sudou\u2019s expulsion, you can inform the class that\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d \n \u201cIs that okay?\u201d \n \u201cYou promised to pay me 100,000 points. There\u2019s nothing more to be done.\u201d Chiyabashira-sensei seemed simultaneously exasperated and amused. \u201cHorikita, do you understand how talented Ayanokouji is? At least somewhat?\u201d \n \u201cI wonder. When I look at him, all I see is a disagreeable student.\u201d \n \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018disagreeable?\u2019\u201d I asked. \n \u201cYou get low scores on purpose when you could easily score higher. You were the one who came up with the idea of getting the old test problems, but you gave Kushida-san the credit. You were even crazy enough to buy test points. I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re special or just deviate from the norm. I think you\u2019re disagreeable.\u201d \n So, she\u2019d heard how I got the old test questions, too. \n \u201cPerhaps the pair of you really can reach the higher-level classes,\u201d Chiyabashira-sensei said. \n \u201cI don\u2019t know about him , but I most definitely will.\u201d \n \u201cNo one from Class D has ever been promoted before. The school has already labeled you defective and will coldly toss you aside. How will you accomplish your goal?\u201d \n \u201cIf I may, sensei?\u201d Horikita unwaveringly returned Chiyabashira-sensei\u2019s gaze. \u201cHonestly, maybe the students in Class D are defective. However, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re trash.\u201d \n \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a defective product and trash?\u201d \n \u201cThe difference is paper thin. However, with repairs, a defective product may become a superior article.\u201d \n \u201cI see. When you say it like that, Horikita, I admit it sounds oddly persuasive.\u201d \n I shared that opinion, and found Horikita\u2019s words to be quite meaningful. Horikita, who had previously looked down upon others and thought of them as baggage, was changing. Of course, nothing was that simple. Though you could just barely glimpse the change from the outside, it was actually a major transformation. A faint smile appeared on Chiyabashira-sensei\u2019s lips, as if she also had noticed it. \n \u201cWell, I look forward to seeing what you do next. As your homeroom teacher, I\u2019ll be sure to watch over you with great attention and care.\u201d \n With that, Chiyabashira-sensei headed toward the faculty room, leaving the two of us in the hall. \n \u201cWell, let\u2019s head back. Class will be starting soon,\u201d I said. \n \u201cAyanokouji-kun.\u201d \n \u201cHmm? Oof!\u201d \n Horikita chopped me in the side. \n \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d \n \u201cFor whatever.\u201d \n She left me as I clutched my sides in agony. Jeez, what a bothersome classm\u2026bothersome person. With that thought, I decided to chase after her. \n "], "Chapter 117": ["==============="], "Chapter 118": ["Chapter 12: Victory Celebration \n \u201cC heers!\u201d Ike shouted joyfully and toasted with a can of juice. That evening, the former association of failures had convened once again. Liberated from our studies, we were all overjoyed that no one had been expelled. Everyone smiled\u2026 Well, except for Horikita. We\u2019d shared our burdens, and together, we\u2019d overcome the challenge. Perhaps that was the point of being young. I guess if you ignored the one dark spot, this wasn\u2019t terrible. \n \u201cWhat\u2019s with the long face, Ayanokouji? Sudou wasn\u2019t expelled. Everything\u2019s fine now, right?\u201d \n \u201cI don\u2019t particularly mind that you\u2019re holding a celebration party, but why are you holding it in my room ?\u201d \n \u201cMine\u2019s a mess. So are Sudou\u2019s and Yamauchi\u2019s. And we can\u2019t go to a girl\u2019s room, right? I mean, yeah, I would\u2019ve loved going to Kushida-chan\u2019s room. But your spectacularly plain and empty room is the best option.\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019s only been two months since school started. I think it\u2019d be weird to have a lot of stuff.\u201d Aside from daily necessities, I didn\u2019t really need anything. \n \u201cWhat do you think, Kushida-chan?\u201d \n \u201cI think it\u2019s fine here. It\u2019s simple, but it feels nice and clean.\u201d \n \u201cRight? Man, it must be nice to have Kushida-chan praise you. Ha ha ha ha!\u201d Ike grudgingly pushed me. \n \u201cAll things considered, though, that midterm was dangerous. If we hadn\u2019t put the study group together, I would\u2019ve been fine, but Ike and Sudou would have definitely gotten kicked out.\u201d \n \u201cHuh? You were close to getting expelled, too, you know.\u201d \n \u201cNo, no, I could have gotten a perfect score if I were serious about it. Really.\u201d \n \u201cEverything was thanks to Horikita-san\u2019s efforts. She tutored Ike, Yamauchi, and Sudou.\u201d \n Horikita sat outside the circle, quietly reading a novel. When we said her name, she bookmarked her page and looked up. \n \u201cI did it for my own sake. If someone had been expelled, Class D\u2019s evaluation would\u2019ve worsened.\u201d \n \u201cJust say that you didn\u2019t want us to get expelled, even if it\u2019s a lie. We\u2019d like you better.\u201d \n \u201cIt\u2019d be fine with me if you didn\u2019t.\u201d \n Well, her attitude remained unchanged, but simply participating in this gathering was a sign of her progress. The old Horikita most definitely would not have come. \n \u201cWell, I guess, but\u2026you\u2019re a surprisingly good person, Horikita,\u201d replied Sudou. \n Since Horikita had apologized to Sudou, he\u2019d completely stopped antagonizing her. Before, he\u2019d said she was a bad person. But people could change. \n \u201cAnyway, why did Chiyabashira-sensei change her mind about expelling Sudou-kun?\u201d \n \u201cI wondered about that, too. What kind of sorcery did you use, Horikita-chan?\u201d \n \u201cHmm, I don\u2019t really remember.\u201d \n \u201cWhoa, it\u2019s a secret?!\u201d \n Ike tumbled over in an exaggerated fashion. \n \u201cEven though we managed to make it through the midterm, we shouldn\u2019t lose our heads. Our next challenge is the final exam. We should expect those questions to be even more difficult than the ones today. In addition, we still need to find a way to increase our points.\u201d \n \u201cDo we really need to start this hellish cramming all over again? This sucks.\u201d Still on the floor, Ike buried his head in his hands. \n \u201cDon\u2019t you think that if we start right now, it won\u2019t be hellish?\u201d \n \u201cNo!\u201d He sounded sure about that. \n \u201cI don\u2019t understand this school at all. I don\u2019t get the class divisions, the point system, anything.\u201d \n \u201cAh, points. I want points! Living in poverty really sucks.\u201d \n After Ike and Yamauchi had used up all of their points, they\u2019d had to resort to living off the school\u2019s free offerings. \n \u201cHey, Horikita-san. Do you think it\u2019ll be really difficult to get more points?\u201d \n \u201cWe tried so hard on the midterm that they\u2019ll definitely give us some points, right?!\u201d \n \u201cDid you not see Class D\u2019s average score? We were the lowest of all of the classes by far. If you think that we\u2019ll get points for that, then I think you need to open your eyes.\u201d Horikita spoke the truth without mercy, without sugarcoating anything. \n \u201cThen we\u2019re not getting any points next month, either. Boo.\u201d \n \u201cI think you should learn to live a more modest life and give up on points.\u201d \n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ike-kun. We may not get any points right now, but surely we\u2019ll get some soon. Right, Horikita-san?\u201d \n \u201cI wonder about that.\u201d \n \u201cCan I say something? We\u2019re all friends here, after all. Horikita-san, Ayanokouji-kun, and I are all working together to get into Class A. If you\u2019re okay with it, I want you three to help us,\u201d Kushida said. \n \u201cGet into\u2026Class A? A-are you serious?\u201d Ike said. \n \u201cYes. I absolutely am. Increasing our points is an inevitable part of getting to the top as well.\u201d \n \u201cB-but, isn\u2019t the idea of reaching Class A kind of ridiculous? They\u2019re all smart, right? It\u2019d be impossible for us to win against those guys by studying.\u201d \n When you considered their average test scores, everyone in that class was probably on Horikita\u2019s level. \n \u201cStudying isn\u2019t the sole factor in deciding who goes into what class, though. Right?\u201d \n \u201cYeah, but if you can\u2019t study at all , then moving up is out of the question.\u201d \n The three least-academically gifted people averted their eyes and whistled nonchalantly. \n \u201cWe\u2019re still far from our goal, but we can do it if we all work together. I know it.\u201d \n "], "Chapter 119": ["==============="], "Chapter 120": [" filename=\"static\\uploads\\Classroom of the Elite - Volume 01 [Seven Seas][Kobo]\\images\\image19.jpg\"", "==============="], "Chapter 121": ["\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d \n \u201cWhat makes me sure, hmm? Well, you know what they say, \u2018A single arrow is easily broken, but not ten in a bundle,\u2019 I suppose.\u201d \n \u201cI think that even if you bundled these ten together, they\u2019d still break,\u201d Horikita said. \n \u201cW-well how about this? Three heads are better than one! Or something like that,\u201d Kushida said. \n \u201cI guess if you combined all three of their test scores, you\u2019d get one normal person\u2019s grade.\u201d Every time Kushida tried to raise the three up, Horikita would knock them back down. What an amazing pair. \n \u201cIf we keep going back and forth like this, though, we won\u2019t get anywhere.

At any rate, if we wanted to move up, we\u2019d need to get along with as many of our classmates as possible.

I guess.\u201d Sudou tried to hide his embarrassment when he spoke. \n \u201cI never wanted your help, Sudou-kun. Besides, I have a hard time imagining how you\u2019ll be useful in the first place.\u201d \n \u201cGrr. I just thought I\u2019d try to be nice, is all, and\u2014\u201d \n \u201cYou were trying to be nice? I\u2019m surprised.\u201d \n Unsurprisingly, Sudou looked angry, but it didn\u2019t seem like he was going to raise his fist. Wow, he was making progress, too. \n \u201cYou\u2019re a really annoying girl,\u201d he said. \n \u201cThank you. I appreciate your words of praise.\u201d \n \u201cYou are not cute at all, lady.\u201d \n \u201cYou say that, but how do you really feel?\u201d teased Ike. \n Sudou instantly glared at Ike and put him in a headlock. \n \u201cOw! Ow, ow! S-stop!\u201d \n \u201cIf you say anything else, I\u2019m going to strangle you!\u201d \n \u201cY-you already are strangling me, jeez! I give, I give!\u201d \n Horikita sighed deeply. Her eyes seemed to ask, Is this male bonding? \n \u201cIn this school, ability is paramount. I\u2019m positive that our competition will grow even more severe moving forward. If you say you\u2019ll work with us, know that you can\u2019t do so half-heartedly. Otherwise you\u2019ll be a burden.\u201d \n \u201cWell, if it comes down to physical ability, leave it to me. I have serious basketball and fighting skills.\u201d \n \u201cI really can\u2019t expect anything from you at all.\u201d \n Ability was paramount, huh? I felt my chest tighten. We\u2019d been isolated from the world and now thrust into this situation. Perhaps we were cursed. \n Horikita seriously planned on getting into Class A. Her will was unshakeable. However, our path out of Class D would not be an easy one. Considering our current performance, it was hard to imagine us even reaching Class C. What should we do from here? I imagined that things would turn out as they should. For the time being, I\u2019d do my best. At the very least, though\u2026I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing Horikita smile. \n "], "Chapter 122": ["==============="], "Chapter 123": ["Postscript \n I sincerely apologize for the long silence. This is Kinugasa Syougo. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. I wrote this story about a year ago. Classroom of the Elite came out of my transition from student to adult, and because I wanted to tackle a challenging subject. When I think back to my student days, I recall everyone continuously telling me that I had to study if I wanted to get into a good university, if I wanted to get a job in a good field, if I wanted to have a good life. Recently, I\u2019ve had my doubts as to whether that advice was actually correct. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve gone astray, and leapt into a world far different from the one that my family and peers imagined for me\u2026 \n Of course, studying is important, and there\u2019s no doubt that it is useful for a person\u2019s future. But I believe that academics aren\u2019t everything. For an easy example, sports are often part of an academic curriculum. Many people participate in sports. Everyone\u2019s personality is unique, though. A child who has a talent for drawing might become an illustrator, or someone with the comedic gift might become an entertainer. Besides academics and sports, there are a near-infinite variety of callings and professions that suit all different types of people. \n When I started thinking about this, I began to consider those regrets that adults face for the first time. I thought, \u201cIf only I\u2019d done this,\u201d and started to regret my past. Lately, these ideas have been constantly on my mind. \n Now, I\u2019d like to list some acknowledgements. \n Tomose Shunsaku-sama. Thank you so much for working with me time and time again. The male characters you draw are so wonder\u2014no, I should say I give you my sincerest thanks because you draw both male and female characters that simply overflow with charm. \n I will always make sure to show you how appreciative and thankful I am for your help. I sincerely look forward to working with you in the future. We should really go out to get some yakiniku soon. My treat. One of those cheap all-you-can-eat places! \n My editor, I-sama. Thank you so much for going over my writing. Though I\u2019ve placed many burdens upon you with my previous work, I am sincerely grateful for all the effort you\u2019ve put in, especially when this took a rather long time to complete. Huh? You say to knock it off and cut you a break? Ha ha ha, what a great joke. We have a long, long way to go. A one-way ticket all the way to the depths of hell. At least we\u2019re falling together, right? \n Finally, there is you, the reader. Because you\u2019re holding this book, you could say that in some sense you play a part in its central theme. While I am incredibly grateful to you more than anyone, I think we can conclude this volume here. It\u2019s already the spring of 2015, but, as usual, my physical health is hardly perfect. I continue my longstanding battle with insomnia, but I\u2019ll keep doing my best not to lose. \n "], "Chapter 124": ["==============="], "Chapter 125": [" filename=\"static\\uploads\\Classroom of the Elite - Volume 01 [Seven Seas][Kobo]\\images\\image20.jpg\"", "==============="], "Chapter 126": ["\n \n Thank you for reading! \n Get the latest news about your favorite Seven Seas books and brand-new licenses delivered to your inbox every week: \n Sign up for our newsletter! \n Or visit us online: \n gomanga.com/newsletter \n "], "Chapter 127": ["==============="]}
